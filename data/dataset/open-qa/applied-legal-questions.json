        "answer": "A juvenile court, either on its own volition or upon the application of the Director of Social Welfare (“the Director”), which is satisfied that any child or juvenile is in need of care or protection, may appoint the Director to be the legal guardian of such child or juvenile. Alternatively, the court may commit the care to any person, whether a relative or not, who is willing to undertake the care of the child, or to any institution which is willing to do so. The court can also order parents or guardians to enter into a recognizance to exercise proper care and guardianship or place the person for a specified period, not exceeding three years, under the supervision of a person appointed for the purpose by the court.\n\nThe [Protection of Children and Juveniles Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/213/) enables police officers and social workers to take action to protect a child or juvenile in need of care or protection.",

        "answer": "It is an ordeal for the child victim of violence or sexual abuse to face his/her abuser in open court and be subjected to traditional forms of cross examination. Protection must be afforded to children in such situations if their best interests are to be protected.\n\nThere are legislations that provide some protection for children and juvenile victims of certain sexual or physical offences when they are giving evidence in court as prosecution witnesses. This is done by shielding them from the full rigour of the traditional trial format. This includes allowing a child (other than the defendant) to give evidence and be cross examined by way of a live television link, or giving evidence by way of a pre-recorded video interview.\n\nThese provisions recognise and attempt to reduce the trauma that child and juvenile victims of physical and sexual abuse face when giving evidence as prosecution witnesses. Inevitably this means some reduction in the rights of defendants, but these reductions are proportional and objectively justified in the interests of protecting children when giving evidence in court.",

        "answer": "Other than contacting the sellers or service suppliers directly, you may approach the following organizations:\n\n**Consumer Council**\n\nThe Consumer Council is a body corporate subsidized by Government funding. The functions of the Council are stipulated by law, which include providing consumers with information on goods and services, acting as mediator in resolving consumer complaints, tendering advice on policies touching on consumer rights and interest, and encouraging businesses and professional associations to establish codes of practice.\n\nSince the Council is not a law-enforcement body, it has no authority to sue sellers or service suppliers. The relevant complaints are dealt with by way of mediation. However, the Council can censure trade mal-practices by naming/publicizing the sellers or service suppliers concerned. For cases that involve significant consumer interest but cannot be resolved by mediation or other means, applications for assistance can be made to the Consumer Legal Action Fund.\n\nConsumer Council hotline: 29292222\n\n**Customs and Excise Department**\n\nFor problems concerning “trade descriptions” or “safety of goods” (short weights and measures, overstating the fineness of gold and platinum, unsafe toys and children’s products, etc.) you can complain to the Customs and Excise Department directly.\n\nGeneral enquiry hotline: 28157711\nComplaint hotline: 81003553\n\n**Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong (complaints against travel agents)**\n\nThe Travel Industry Council (“TIC”) is entrusted with the responsibility to regulate outbound and inbound travel agents under the [Travel Agents Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/218/index.html) ( [Cap. 218](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/218/index.html) of the Laws of Hong Kong).

No person can be represented by a lawyer in the Small Claims Tribunal (but you can consult a lawyer before attending the Tribunal’s hearing). Types of claims can be handled by the Small Claims Tribunal include debts, service charges, damage to property, and consumer claims (e.g. claims relating to goods or services with poor quality).\n\n**District Court or High Court**\n\nIf the amount of your claim is over $75,000, you must submit your claim to the District Court or the High Court. The maximum claim that can be handled by the District Court is $3,000,000. While for the High Court, there is no upper limit on the claim amount. Since the claim amount is bigger and the procedures involved are much more complex, you are strongly advised to find a lawyer to represent you in any proceedings in these two courts. You may also apply for legal aid if you satisfy certain conditions set out by the Legal Aid Department.\n\n**Consumer Legal Action Fund**\n\nThe Consumer Council runs a Consumer Legal Action Fund (“the Fund”), which will assist consumers to pursue their matters in courts. If you are an eligible consumer or a group of eligible consumers involved in a matter which relates to consumer transactions, or involves significant public interest or injustice, you can apply for legal assistance under the Fund.",

If a winding-up order has been granted against the company (in case it is a limited company), then the aggrieved consumers are legally entitled to recover their payment for the tickets. However, the consumers will only be treated as ordinary or unsecured creditors on claiming their loss. Consumers will usually recover no more than a small proportion of the debt.

Offenders are liable to prosecution and to a maximum fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for 14 years.\n\nApart from living arrangement, an employer also has duty to provide food free of charge to the helper.",

        "answer": "If the employment relationship between an employer and a foreign domestic helper is terminated prior to the expiry of the contracted period (whether it is by notice, by payment in lieu or by immediate termination), both the employer and the foreign domestic helper shall notify the Director of Immigration within seven days of the date of termination.\n\nA foreign domestic helper is permitted to remain in Hong Kong for not more than two weeks after premature termination of the employment contract. If the foreign domestic helper does not leave upon the expiry of stay, he/she will commit an offence for breaching his/her condition of stay.\n\nSince the foreign domestic helper is imported labour invited to work in Hong Kong, an employer shall be responsible for sending him/her back to his/her country of origin upon the termination or expiry of an employment contract by providing him/her with free return passage to his/her place of origin.",

        "answer": "The law allows an employer to make deductions for damage or loss to the employer’s goods or property directly attributable to the helper’s negligence or default. This right to deduction, however, is subject to the limit of HK$300 for each damaged item. Further, the total of such deductions shall not exceed one quarter of the wages payable to the helper in that wage period. For example, if you are paying your foreign domestic helper the monthly salary of HK$4,010, and if he/she negligently broke 5 valuable porcelain items (each worth more than HK$300) in a month, you can at most deduct HK$1,002.50 (being one quarter of HK$4,010), not HK$1,500 (being HK$300 x 5 items) from the helper’s salary for this month.",

This“Power of Arrest”enables the police to arrest the abuser where the abuser is reasonably suspected of breaching the injunction by reason of violence or by entering into or remaining in the area specified in the injunction.\n\nThe application forms for injunction orders can be obtained from a solicitor, the Legal Aid Department, or the Family Court Registry.\n\nIf you or your children or other family members are assaulted or threatened by your spouse/partner or other family members, you should report the matter to the police.

Failure to comply may result in a fine.\n\nYou may be guilty of a criminal offence and be fined if you did not do all you reasonably could to prevent your dog from biting a person. Pursuant to a complaint being lodged, a magistrate may rule that a dog is dangerous and an order may be made that the dog be destroyed or must be kept under effective control.\n\nIf you are negligent in controlling your dog, you may also be liable for compensation in a civil action if it bites a human or other animal.

        "answer": "Under the [Public Health (Animals and Birds) (Animal Traders) Regulations](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/139B/) ([Cap. 139B](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/139B/)) it is not legal to carry on a business as an animal trader without a licence. Besides, all premises used for the sale of animals are required to be licensed.\n\nLicences are issued by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) and require an animal trader to comply with health and welfare conditions set out by the Department. Primary enclosures, housing facilities and outdoor areas, for example, are required to comply with the Department’s licensing conditions. The sale of diseased animals is prohibited.\n\nThe conditions attached to an Animal Traders Licence under [Reg 5(3)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/139B/s5.html) of the [Public Health (Animals and Birds) (Animal Traders) Regulations](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/139B/) require that:\n\n1. All dogs for sale in licensed premises have a microchip device with an individual code number implanted under the skin.\n2. Before sale, dogs of over five months of age must not only have the above mentioned microchip implanted, but must also have a dog licence from the AFCD.\n3. The pet shop or breeder must have a scanner for reading the microchip devices in the dogs for sale available for customers on the pet shop premises at all times.\n4. All dogs must be vaccinated against distemper, parvovirus and infectious hepatitis before they can be legally sold. An animal trader is required to keep certificates for these vaccinations (issued by a veterinary surgeon) for every dog offered for sale.

        "answer": "Instead of leaving your dog behind, you may consider taking your dog with you. Overseas countries have their own import requirements and many will require advance planning and vaccinations before the animal can be transported abroad. In Hong Kong there are a few commercial companies that can assist with the logistical arrangements for moving pets to countries abroad. If it is truly impossible to take the animal to the new country and the owner is migrating permanently then careful arrangements should be made for its re-homing with friends in Hong Kong. Giving animals to already overcrowded animal shelters is not usually in the best interests of an animal which has known the security of a private home. Giving the animal to strangers met on the Internet may result in it ending up abandoned or imprisoned in a puppy/kitten breeding farm.",

It is an offence punishable by a fine of $1,000 and imprisonment for two months to send any message by telephone or wireless telegraphy which is grossly offensive, or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character. It is also an offence under the same section to send any message known to be false for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to any other person, or to persistently make telephone calls without reasonable cause for any of those purposes.\n\n[Section 20](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s20.html) extends to messages sent by social network apps for smartphones through the Internet: e.g. WhatsApp, Line or Skype.\n\nSometimes, persistent telephone calls, particularly silent calls, can be disruptive and harmful to mental or physical health, particularly if the victim is known to be alone and afraid. As established in English case law, recognisable psychiatric illness can amount to bodily harm (but this does not include fear, distress or panic).

A crime is an offence against society as a whole and is prosecuted by the HKSAR Government. The Secretary for Justice has the responsibility for the conduct of criminal prosecutions, including the decision of whether or not to prosecute in a particular case. A tort is a civil wrong and can be the subject of proceedings by the person who is wronged by the stalker’s conduct. A successful criminal prosecution leads to the punishment of the offender. Successful proceedings in tort lead to an award of monetary compensation to the person wronged, and where there is evidence that the wrongful conduct is likely to be repeated, an injunction may be granted to prevent repetition of the wrongful conduct.",

Rather than impose immediate imprisonment, the court which made the injunction may, particularly on the first breach or where the breach is not that serious, accept an undertaking (a promise) from the defendant not to commit further breaches of the injunction. As breach of an injunction is not a criminal offence, the police cannot arrest a person who is in breach of an injunction, unless it is necessary to prevent a breach of peace, or the breach itself amounts to a criminal offence.

        "question": "Apart from going to Court to apply for a divorce, are there any other channels through which a married couple can deal with their unhappy or broken marriage? What are the differences between those other channels and divorce proceedings?",
        "answer": "The alternatives to divorce proceedings available to parties to an unhappy or broken marriage are as follows:\n\n**Deed of Separation**\n\nDeed of Separation is a separation agreement made between the two parties by themselves. The agreement may specify a period of separation, and what the parties may do with their children (if any) and how their children’s and each other’s maintenance will be provided.\n\n**Separation Order**\n\nIf no separation agreement can be reached, one party can apply to the District Court for a separation order together with maintenance orders (e.g. either party may be ordered by the Court to give financial support to the other party, and/or the children, for the costs of living) provided that he or she has not committed adultery. If the Court order that the parties be separated, they need not live together any more although they are still legally husband and wife (they are not free to re-marry at this stage). The Court may also make orders relating to the custody of the children and the maintenance of the other spouse and of the children.\n\n**Judicial Separation**\n\nThe effect of a judicial separation is the same as a separation order, i.e. the parties are still husband and wife but they need not cohabit. Parties who are judicially separated are not free to re-marry. The decree of judicial separation is only granted subject to the requirement that satisfactory arrangements have been made for the welfare of any children.\nThere are several possible reasons why a couple would apply for judicial separation instead of divorce, for example:\n\n- when one or both parties are opposed to divorce on either religious or moral grounds;\n- one party does not wish to give the other the ability to remarry;\n- when the parties have been married for less than 1 year and are therefore unable to apply for divorce;\n- in order to prevent the loss of benefits available only to a spouse.\n\nThe existence of a judicial separation decree does not preclude either party from applying for divorce subsequently.\n\n**Mediation**\n\nFamily mediation is a voluntary problem-solving process designed to help separating/divorcing couples reach their own mutually acceptable agreements regarding on-going arrangements for their children and/or the resolution of financial matters. A trained, impartial third person (the mediator) can assist both parties to communicate and negotiate issues in a confidential setting.",

This means that when you want to take the child out of Hong Kong, all a party needs to do is to obtain a written consent from his/her spouse.\n\n**Permanent removal from Hong Kong**\n\nIf a parent, who is granted with the custody of a child, intends to leave Hong Kong permanently for some reasons, that parent must make an application to Court so as to obtain an order from the Court allowing him or her to remove the child permanently from Hong Kong. If the other parent opposes such application, the judge will have to balance the child’s loss of regular contact with that parent against the liberty of the applicant parent (granted with custody) to choose where he or she wishes to live.",

        "answer": "You may consider the following ways to enforce the court order for maintenance against your former spouse:\n\n**Judgment summons**\n\nYou can apply for a judgment summons. The judge has the power to make a new order for payment of the amount due or to commit your former spouse to prison (according to [Rule 87](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A/s87.html) of the [Matrimonial Causes Rules](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/179A/)) if he or she cannot justify his or her failure to pay. If your former spouse fails to attend the hearings repeatedly, the judge can commit him or her to prison in his or her absence.\n\n**Attachment of income to satisfy order**\n\nWith reference to [section 28](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/192/s28.html) of the [Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/192/), where a maintenance order has been made against a maintenance payer and:\n\n- a court is satisfied that the payer has without reasonable excuse failed to make any payment which he is required to make by the maintenance order; or\n- a court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the payer will not make full and punctual payment in compliance with the maintenance order; or\n- the payer and designated payee agree to the making of an order under this section; and\n\nthere is any income capable of being attached payable to the payer,\nthe Court may order the income to be attached as to the whole or part of the amount payable under the maintenance order and the amount attached to be paid directly from the payer’s sources of income (e.g. his/her employer) to the specified payee. However, the payer could retain certain amount for his/her reasonable living expenses before such deduction.\n\n**Prohibition order**\n\nIt is possible to apply to the Court on an ex-parte basis (applied unilaterally by one party only) for an order that your former spouse be prevented from leaving Hong Kong pending recovery of the debt. This procedure can be very effective in particular when your former spouse travels frequently as it is likely to cause your former spouse considerable inconvenience. However, you should bear in mind that the Court is reluctant to limit a person’s liberty in this way. Therefore such an application should only be made as a last resort only when every other method of enforcement has been exhausted and proved inappropriate.",

You have to establish the fact of adultery. You have to show that your wife has committed adultery, and you find it intolerable to live with her. However, if you and your wife continue to live together for more than six months following the act of adultery, you will not be entitled to rely on the fact of adultery. Besides, you must have certain knowledge that adultery has occurred, not only a belief that there has been adultery.",

The agreement for lease/provisional tenancy agreement is a contract. It must, therefore, satisfy the requirements of a contract. An agreement for lease/provisional tenancy agreement is legally binding upon the parties to the agreement.

The agreement to pay rent is only one of many covenants that are made by the tenant. If, upon regaining possession of the property, the landlord finds that pipes are blocked, walls are painted in weird colours, windows are broken, the refrigerator is gone, trash is left all over the property, etc., and that the tenant cannot be located anymore, the deposit will not be able to cover the aggregate of the unpaid rent and the expenses incurred to refurbish the property.

        "question": "Why is it important for the owners’ corporation to have Third Party Risks Insurance?",
        "answer": "In 1994, the canopy of a seafood restaurant situated at Albert House in Aberdeen collapsed. One passer-by was killed and 13 others were injured in the incident. The High Court held that the owners’ corporation, property management company, restaurant, licencee of the restaurant, owner of the unit at which the restaurant was situated and contractor that had built the canopy were liable for compensation to the victims, which amounted to more than HK$30 million. Since the owners’ corporation of Albert House did not have third party risks insurance, it was unable to pay the compensation. Eventually, the owners’ corporation had to be wound up. Pursuant to the [Building Management Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/) ( [Cap. 344](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/) of the Laws of Hong Kong), each of the individual owners was liable and had to pay a portion of the compensation for his/her share of the liability.\n\nThe message from this case is that compensation must be paid if the court rules that the victim must be compensated. If the OC does not have third party risks insurance, it has to make full compensation. If it does not have sufficient funds to pay compensation and has to be wound up, each individual owner becomes personally liable for the compensation. If individual owners are unable to pay compensation, they may be forced into bankruptcy. Procuring third party risks insurance protects the owners and any potential third party victims, thus reducing the financial risks faced by the owners should an accident occur.",

        "answer": "If it is shown that you and your partner had an intention (whether express, implied or presumed) as to how the flat was to be owned, then generally the intention would prevail. But if no such intention can be shown, then whether you have any interest in the flat would depend on whether the circumstances have given rise to a “constructive trust” in your favour. The principle is that if the flat is held in your partner’s name in circumstances where it is fair and just that you should have a share in the flat, your partner is compelled to hold your share on a “constructive trust” for you. The issue is whether you have done “enough” to justify an equitable claim.",

        "answer": "If you and your husband have contributed towards the purchase price of the flat, both of you are co-owners of the flat. Even though your husband is not a registered legal owner, he would be a beneficial owner of the flat.\n\nAs to how your shares of the flat are worked out, it would depend on the respective contributions of you and your husband towards the purchase price. If both of you have contributed equally towards the purchase price, both of you are presumed to own the flat equally as “joint tenants”. Joint tenants are subject to the “right of survivorship”, which stipulates that upon the death of an owner, his/her interest will automatically pass to and shared equally by the surviving owners.\n\nOn the other hand, if the contributions of you and your husband are unequal, then it is presumed that both of you own the flat as “tenants in common”, with each owning a share proportionate to the amount of your contributions. For example, if your husband has contributed one-third and you two-thirds of the purchase price, your husband and you will own respectively one-third and two-thirds of the flat as tenants in common. Tenants in common are not subject to the “right of survivorship”, and the interest of any owner who dies will pass under his/her will (or under the law of intestacy, if the owner dies without a will).\n\nThe presumptions of “joint tenants” and “tenants in common” can be rebutted by evidence that you and your husband intended to hold as joint tenants despite unequal contributions, or that both of you intended to own as tenants in common despite equal contributions.",

Generally speaking, the court would take into consideration the conduct of the parties and all the circumstances of the case, such as the financial resources, financial needs and age of each of the parties, the contribution of each party to the welfare of the family, the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage, and the duration of the marriage.

        "answer": "Under the principle of “Utmost Good Faith”, the insured person or the policyholder has the duty to disclose to the insurance company all the information relating to the purchase of the insurance.\n\n\nTherefore, irrespective of there having been a medical examination conducted by a doctor appointed by the insurance company who failed to diagnose the health problem, the insurance company may still deny your claim. This is particularly so if your non\\-disclosure is material and affected the assessment of your risk profile by the insurance company.",

        "answer": "Refer to the terms and conditions of your Life Insurance Policy to check whether there is any provision for redemption of the insurance premium before the death of the policyholder.\n\n\nSome Life Insurance Policies offer a Guaranteed Cash Value that accumulates throughout the policy term. You can receive it in a lump sum if you terminate the policy or when the plan matures and terminates once the insured person reaches a certain age.",

        "question": "My insurance agent asked me to transfer my existing Life Insurance Policy to another insurance company. Would there be any potential losses arising from such a transfer?",
        "answer": "Prior to switching your Life Insurance Policy to another insurance company, you should be careful that your agent is not making inaccurate or misleading statements or comparisons to persuade you to switch. This is not uncommon, as your agent may earn a commission from your switching to another insurance company (where the agent is also switching to a new insurance company).\n\n\nThere are two major matters that you must consider carefully.\n\n\nFirstly, in connection with your application for the new insurance, you will be required to answer questions about your health, occupation and lifestyle. If the new insurance company rejects your application because of any of the updated information disclosed in the application, you may be required to inform your existing insurance company of the rejection and the reason(s) under the “change of circumstances” clause (if any) in your existing policy. This may lead to your existing insurance company canceling your policy or requiring you to pay a higher premium.\n\n\nSecondly, the new policy may contain different provisions and the “incontestable period” under the new policy may start afresh. The worst case is the possibility of a claim being rejected under the new policy which would otherwise have been paid under the existing policy.\n\n\nIn order to protect consumers against the above risks, there is a requirement for them to complete the Customer Protection Declaration Form (the “CPD Form”), which can be downloaded from the website of the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers. Where there is a switching or replacement of a policy, the insurance agent must declare on the CPD Form that he/she has fully explained the possible risks to the client. The client must also declare that he/she understands these risks. In this case, the cooling\\-off period is 14 days from the date a copy of the CPD Form is delivered to the existing insurance company by the new insurance company.\n\n\nIn summary, make sure that your insurance agent is not making inaccurate or misleading statements or comparisons to persuade you to switch. Any additional genuine and legitimate benefit available under the new policy may make it worth switching, but you must be clear on the potential risks and what can be done to manage these risks.",

        "answer": "Yes, you can name your son (who is a minor) as the beneficiary of your Life Insurance Policy.\n\n\nYou should arrange to name a guardian and/or trustee to receive and manage the proceeds on his behalf until he reaches the age of majority, after which he can inherit all the proceeds directly.",

        "answer": "Firstly, if the beneficiary is in a legal position to do so (e.g. he/she is the spouse, parent or child of the insured person), the beneficiary must obtain a court declaration that the insured person is legally dead. In Common Law, a person is considered legally dead if the person has disappeared for seven years or more, unless there is any evidence to the contrary.\n\n\nOnce the court issues a declaration that the insured person is legally dead, the beneficiary can submit a claim to the insurance company for the death benefit. Regarding the procedural details on how to apply for a court declaration, please consult a solicitor.",

        "answer": "Usually there is a “reinstatement” clause which provides that a Life Insurance Policy that has lapsed (usually due to non\\-payment of premiums) can be reinstated provided that certain conditions are met.\n\n\nIt may be less expensive to reinstate a policy than to purchase a new one. The premium for a new policy would likely be more expensive since the insured person would have grown older. Therefore, the person’s risk profile would likely fall into a higher premium category.\n\n\nThe insured person may need to show to the insurance company evidence of insurability (e.g. a satisfactory medical report). This condition is usually waived for lapses of less than two months.\n\n\nDuring the time in which the policy reinstatement is being processed, any claim submitted would be held pending the approval of the reinstatement application by the insurance company.",

It would also be advisable to give a copy of your life insurance policy to the intended executor of your estate and/or the beneficiaries, as you deem appropriate, so that someone whom you trust knows about the policy and will take active steps to make a claim with the insurance company after your death.\n\n\nIt is appropriate and prudent to inform someone you trust that you have purchased a life insurance policy; otherwise, if no one knows about the existence of the Policy, it may go unclaimed. Another consideration is that the insurance company may not know the insured person has passed away.",

        "answer": "The parties should first refer to the terms in their contracts (i.e. the contract(s) that are providing the subject matter of their disputes).\n\n \n\nIn most commercial contracts (e.g. construction, insurance), there will normally be an arbitration clause stating that when there are disputes arising from the contract, the parties should refer to arbitration before instituting legal proceedings. The parties are therefore bound by their contracts to go for arbitration before commencing any civil action in Court. [see: [Introduction](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/ADR/introduction) - Arbitration]\n\n \n\nAlthough mediation is the ADR recommended by the Judiciary, the parties are free to choose either arbitration or mediation to resolve their dispute.\n\n \n\nNo party shall be compelled to go to mediation as it is purely voluntary.\n\n \n\nIf the parties chose to go for arbitration, the award made by the arbitrator(s) would be final and binding on the parties.\n\n \n\nOn the contrary, a mediator would not impose a settlement. It is entirely for the parties to decide whether to settle and if so on what terms. A settlement after mediation is an agreement rather than an enforceable award.",

(Where an arbitration falls within the domestic regime, unless the parties have agreed otherwise there shall be only one arbitrator).\n\nMediation, however, is a voluntary process and no party can be forced to go to mediation and no party can be forced to appoint a particular mediator.",

        "question": "WHAT CAN YOU DO IF YOU ARE SEXUALLY HARASSED?",
        "answer": "Ignoring sexual harassment does not make it go away, but may make it worse because the harasser may misinterpret no response as approval of the behaviour. The Equal Opportunities Commission has recommended some informal and formal strategies that can be used:\n\n \n\n- Speak up at the time. Tell the harasser that his/her behaviour is unwelcome and has to stop;\n- Keep a written record of the incidents, including dates, time, places, presence of any witnesses, nature of the harassment (what the harasser said and did) and your responses;\n- Tell someone you trust;\n- Identify an expert or counsellor who can provide emotional support and information about informal and formal institutional procedures;\n- Write a letter/note to the harasser;\n- Report it officially (e.g. to a senior staff in the company or the school principal);\n- Complain to the Equal Opportunities Commission (please refer to [Part VI: How to Complain](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/how_to_complain));\n- Contact the police and/or file a lawsuit.\n\nThe judgment of a District Court Equal Opportunities Action in 2000 (please click [here](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2000/14.html) if you want to read the whole judgment) has explained that whether or not sexual conduct is unwelcome and unlawful depends on two questions: i) whether the complainant welcomed or accepted the conduct at the relevant time (but not whether a \"reasonable person\" would have welcomed it); and ii) whether the circumstances were such that the harasser should have realized that his/her approaches were unwelcome.\n\n \n\nMost sexual harassment court cases requires the victim to prove that \"unwelcome sexual conduct\" has occurred, therefore, it is very important that you expressly tell the harasser to stop right at the beginning of the incident. Otherwise, you may have great difficulty proving the existence of \"unwelcome sexual conduct\" if you subsequently lodge a complaint or institute legal proceedings.",

        "question": "IF AN INCIDENT INVOLVING SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAPPENED IN AN OFFICE OR ANOTHER PART OF THE WORKPLACE, TO WHAT EXTENT MAY THE EMPLOYER BE HELD RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE?",
        "answer": "With reference to [section 46](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/480/s46.html) of the [SDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/480/), employers may also be liable for acts of sexual harassment committed by their employees in the course of employment, regardless of whether or not the acts were done with the employers' knowledge or approval. However, it is a defence for the employers to show that they have taken reasonably practicable steps to prevent employees from committing such acts. The [Code of Practice on Employment under the Sex Discrimination Ordinance](https://www.eoc.org.hk/en/training-and-education/eo-club/code-practice-on-employment/sex-discrimination-ordinance) (issued by the Equal Opportunities Commission) contains some practicable steps or guidelines for employers' reference. The important points are highlighted below:\n\n \n\n- employers should issue a policy statement to employees which expressly states that sexual harassment at work is unlawful and will not be permitted;\n- the statement should also expressly state that employees have a right to complain if they are suffering from sexual harassment;\n- a co-ordinator, preferably with special training, should be designated to establish and administer both formal and informal complaints procedures.\n\nThere may be both formal and informal ways of dealing with complaints of sexual harassment. The two approaches are both valid and can be included in a sexual harassment policy. The approach to take will usually depend on the wishes of the complainant. Employers need to set out clear procedures for both approaches and make the information available to all staff. This is particularly important in helping staff to understand the steps involved when making a complaint of sexual harassment.\n\n \n\nConfidentiality would also strengthen any policy regarding handling sexual harassment. In short, any information relating to a complaint of sexual harassment must only be given out on a need-to-know basis. Employers need to ensure that managers understand this principle when dealing with such complaints. Adopting such a principle gives assurance to the complainant or potential complainant that management appreciates the sensitive nature of sexual harassment and that the details of complaint will not be disclosed to other colleagues.\n\n \n\nFor more information on how to formulate a policy on handling sexual harassment at work, please refer to clauses 19 – 22 of the Code of Practice.",

        "question": "A SECURITY GUARD NEAR THEIR HOME OPENLY TEASES THEIR SON ABOUT HIS DISABLED LEG. IS THIS UNLAWFUL UNDER THE DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ORDINANCE?",
        "answer": "Harassment (in the context of disability discrimination) is any unwelcome conduct on account of a person's disability where it can be reasonably anticipated that the person would be offended, humiliated or intimidated (e.g. insulting remarks or offensive jokes about a person's disability). Harassment of a person with a disability is unlawful under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/).\n\n \n\nVilification is an activity in public which incites hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of people with a disability. For example, if a person speaks openly in public that people with a disability are useless and a burden to society, this may amount to vilification. Vilification against a person with a disability is also unlawful under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/).\n\n \n\nIn view of the above, the security guard may be liable for harassment and vilification under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/).",

        "question": "MR. B HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A RESPIRATORY ILLNESS AND HE NEEDS TO SEE A DOCTOR REGULARLY. HIS BOSS HAS SINCE COMMENTED ON HIS SICK LEAVE RECORD, AND THE INCONVENIENCE CAUSED TO OTHER COLLEAGUES DURING HIS ABSENCE. JUST A MONTH AGO, HE WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR ONE WEEK DUE TO HIS WORSENING HEALTH. WHEN HE RETURNED TO WORK, HE WAS DISMISSED ON THE BASIS THAT HE HAD TAKEN TOO MUCH SICK LEAVE. IS IT UNLAWFUL FOR HIS EMPLOYER TO DISMISS HIM BECAUSE HE SUFFERS FROM A CHRONIC ILLNESS AND THEREFORE REQUIRES REGULAR MEDICAL TREATMENT?",
        "answer": "When a serious illness prevents an employee from performing [the inherent requirements of the job](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/discrimination_due_to_disability/q3), the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) permits the employer to terminate him. However, the law also requires the employer to consider providing reasonable accommodation (e.g. allowing time-off for medical treatment in the subject case) to the employee with the disability, so as to enable that employee to perform the inherent requirements of the job.\n\n \n\nIf Mr. B's employer dismissed him without first making, or trying to make that accommodation, his employer might be in breach of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/). However, if his employer can prove he has experienced unjustifiable hardship in providing such accommodation (e.g. it seriously hinders Mr. B's job duties or the company does not have adequate financial/human resources to make or continue the relevant arrangements), his employer could claim exemption under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) and in that case the dismissal would not be unlawful.\n\n \n\nEmployers should also note the provisions in the [Employment Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/57/) with regard to granting sick leave.

        "answer": "The school should not make any assumptions regarding the abilities of students with disabilities and should not arbitrarily identify such students as not being capable of performing certain types of activities. Instead, the school should discuss special needs with disabled students themselves, and/or their parents, and determine what is necessary to accommodate those needs.\n\n \n\nThe school may consult the Education Department, special schools or rehabilitation organizations when necessary with a view to providing reasonable accommodation for the students with disabilities and ensuring that extra curricular activities are flexible enough to meet the individual needs of the students. Reasonable a ccommodation is considered as measures or action taken in order to provide equal opportunities for students with disabilities, such as the provision of aids, facilities or services to meet their individual needs.\n\n \n\nThe school may have violated the [Disability Discrimination Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) if it does not provide reasonable accommodation to disabled students unless providing such accommodation would impose unjustified hardship on the school (e.g. the school would suffer financial difficulty when providing such accommodation).\n\n \n\nIn order to eliminate discrimination against students with disabilities, educational establishments should set up a separate policy regarding this matter, or include in their existing policy a specific section on the goal of equal opportunities for students with disabilities. For details of such policies, please refer to [section 11 in the Code of Practice on Education under the DDO ](https://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/Upload/cop/ddo/cop_edu_e.htm#_Toc514474820)(issued by the Equal Opportunities Commission).",

        "question": "THEIR SON HAS BEEN TEASED BY HIS CLASSMATES BECAUSE OF HIS DISABILITY. IS THE SCHOOL LIABLE FOR ACTS OF HARASSMENT AND VILIFICATION COMMITTED BY A STUDENT AGAINST ANOTHER STUDENT WITH A DISABILITY?",
        "answer": "Students should understand that they could also be liable under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/), and schools should also explain this liability to their students.\n\n \n\nStudents should not harass or vilify any other students or staff members in school. Generally, a school is not liable under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) for acts committed by its students. However, if a school has knowledge of discriminatory acts committed by its students against another student with a disability, but it fails to take any action to punish the discriminator(s) or to protect the disabled student, the school may be liable for discrimination under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/). For example, the school may be liable for disability discrimination under the following circumstances:\n\n \n\nA school often disciplines its students who bully other students in school whenever such bullying acts come to its attention. A student walks with crutches because she had polio. Her classmates have teased her several times when she walks. Sometimes her crutches were even taken away by her classmates. She reported the incidents to the school each time but the school did not take any action either to discipline the harassers or to prevent similar harassing acts from recurring. In that case, the school may also be liable for the discriminatory acts of the harassers.\n\n \n\nGoing back to the subject question, if the school did nothing to help their son or to punish the harassers, that school would be liable.\n\n \n\nFor the purpose of teaching students not to harass or vilify persons with disabilities or to avoid possible legal liability, the Equal Opportunities Commission has published [the Code of Practice on Education](https://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/Upload/cop/ddo/cop_edu_e.htm). Every school must take all reasonably practicable steps to avoid acts of harassment or vilification from occurring.",

Other information required includes: sex or state of pregnancy (for sex discrimination), nature of your disability (for disability discrimination), or marital status and number of children (for family status discrimination), or race (for race discrimination);\n- name of the discriminator/respondent (i.e. name of the person or company that discriminated against you) and their contact information;\n- information supporting your claim of discrimination, harassment, vilification or victimisation;\n- details of any detriment or emotional disturbance you have suffered because of the discriminatory acts;\n- information pertaining to any witness(es), such as their contact information and what they witnessed.\n\nIf you have difficulties in preparing a written complaint, you can call the EOC enquiry hotline at 2511 8211 or e-mail the EOC at [complaint@eoc.org.hk ](mailto:complaint@eoc.org.hk).\n\n \n\nYou may lodge your complaint through the EOC's [on-line complaint form](http://www.eoc.org.hk/EOC/GraphicsFolder/Complaint.aspx), by fax at 2106 2324, by post, or in person at 16/F., 41 Heung Yip Road,Wong Chuk Hang, Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nAfter a complaint is received, the EOC will first investigate the complaint and decide if the complaint has substantial grounds.

Responses (if any) are then made available to the complainant. Witness statements are taken and pertinent materials are gathered to see if the case should be discontinued or proceed to conciliation (see [the next question](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/how_to_complain/q5)). All information gathered during the investigation stage is kept confidential from third parties but may be used in court proceedings.\n\n \n\nThe EOC may decide not to conduct or to discontinue an investigation into a complaint if:\n\n \n\n- more than 12 months have passed since the discriminatory act was done;\n- the act complained of is not unlawful;\n- the aggrieved person does not desire to continue with the investigation;\n- the complaint cannot be pursued appropriately only as a representative complaint (i.e. the complaint should be personally lodged by the aggrieved person instead of being lodged through a representative);\n- the complaint is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance.",

        "question": "HOW DOES THE EOC CONCILIATE A CASE? CAN THE AGGRIEVED PERSON REQUEST CONCILIATION?",
        "answer": "After receiving a complaint, the EOC must first carry out an investigation and decide whether to discontinue the case, or proceed to conciliation. When the investigation is completed, either side can also request that the case be settled through conciliation. However, **conciliation is completely voluntary and either party can stop the process at any time**.\n\n \n\nThe conciliator of the EOC assists both parties to examine the issues that led to the complaint, identify points of agreement and negotiate a settlement to the dispute. The conciliator does not represent either side but only acts as a facilitator.\n\n \n\n***What are the advantages of conciliation?***\n\n \n\n- Conciliation is free;\n- It is less time consuming than going to court;\n- Unlike court cases, there is no media exposure to the individual parties;\n- It is less formal compared to court trial.\n\n***What settlement terms can I ask for during the conciliation procedure?***\n\n \n\nTerms depend on the circumstances of the dispute. Normally, it is a reversal of the situation that led to the complaint. For example, if a person was dismissed, he could ask to be re-employed. If he was denied a promotion or transfer, he could ask for the promotion or transfer. If training was denied, he could ask for the admission of the training course. Any of these items could be made as a condition in the settlement term. Other possible items include:\n\n \n\n- a letter of apology;\n- implement of equal opportunities policies;\n- financial settlement/compensation;\n- construction of physical access, etc. (for physical disability cases)\n\nFor more information about the conciliation procedure, please go to the [EOC webpage](http://www.eoc.org.hk/EOC/GraphicsFolder/showcontent.aspx?Leaf=1&content=About Conciliation).",

The granting of legal assistance by the EOC is not guaranteed. It may be granted if the EOC thinks that it is unreasonable, because of the complexity of the case or the complainant's position in relation to the respondent, to expect the complainant to deal with the case unaided.\n\n \n\nLegal assistance may include the giving of legal advice, representation by the EOC's lawyers, legal representation by outside lawyers or any other form of assistance the EOC considers appropriate. A committee of the EOC considers all applications. If you wish to seek further information from the EOC, please click [here](https://www.eoc.org.hk/en/about-the-eoc/contact-us).\n\n \n\nIf you fail to get legal assistance from the EOC, you may consider the Legal Aid Scheme run by the Legal Aid Department.

In the interview, he was asked to take a written test in Chinese, but failed to complete it. He was not offered the job. Does this amount to racial discrimination?",
        "answer": "Arguably, this case could be considered to be a form of indirect discrimination because the employer applied a criterion which, although applied to all candidates equally, would be harder for persons of particular racial backgrounds to meet. This could constitute indirect discrimination unless the employer was able to show that proficiency in reading and writing Chinese was a “genuine occupational requirement” for the job, an exception provided for under [section 10](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/602/s10.html) of the [RDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/602/).\n\n \n\nIn the example above, the rejection would probably constituted racial discrimination unless the employer could show that Mr. B could not have carried out his duties effectively as a security guard without the ability to read and write Chinese.

It is known, however, that facemasks could be used as to address the safety and health concerns without requiring a person to shave off his beard. Is the requirement that Mr. C must shave his beard or face termination a form of racial discrimination?",

Furthermore, the ban would be unjustifiable, despite the apparent justification for the requirement, because there is a practicable alternative, which can fulfill the occupational need for meeting the health and safety requirements in question.\n\n \n\nIn general, any restriction prohibiting persons from wearing customary clothing (such as turbans) central to their identity is discriminatory, unless it can be shown that it is a necessary measure to protect the safety of the employee and that there are no practical alternatives which could achieve the same result without the discriminatory policy.",

        "question": "UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES CAN AN EMPLOYER REFUSE TO EMPLOY OR DISMISS A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY? SUPPOSE I HAVE A SERIOUS LEG INJURY, DOES IT MEAN THAT I HAVE NO CHANCE TO TAKE UP A JOB?",
        "answer": "In general, it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee on the grounds of disability. The [Disability Discrimination Ordinance (\"DDO\")](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) applies to all employers in Hong Kong unless their employees wholly or mainly work outside Hong Kong ([section 11](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s11.html) and [section 14](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s14.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/)).\n\n \n\nHowever, the above protection for job applicants or employees with a disability is not absolute. An employer may specify that a job applicant or an employee should not be a person with a certain type of disability because such person would be unable to carry out the **inherent requirements** **of that particular employment** ( [section 12(2)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s12.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/)). For example, an employer may specify that persons who are wheelchair bound need not apply for jobs like gym instructors, as an inherent requirement of the job of gym instructors is to help people use the gym equipment and perform the relevant demonstrations.\n\n \n\nApplying the above gym instructor example, if you have a leg injury (in which you cannot perform the demonstrations) and you apply for this job, the employer can turn down your application on the grounds that you cannot carry out the inherent requirements of the job.\n\n \n\n***How can one assess whether a job applicant/employee with a disability can carry out the inherent requirements of a job?***\n\n \n\nThe inherent requirements of a job are those that are necessary for achieving the goals of the job (i.e. the duties and responsibilities that an employee must be able to perform/undertake). In determining whether or not a person with a disability can carry out the inherent requirements of the job, the employer is required to take into account:\n\n \n\n1. the person's past training, qualifications and experience relevant to the particular employment;\n2. in the case of an existing employee, his/her work performance; and\n3. other relevant factors (e.g. Is the injury/disability a permanent or temporary one? If it is a temporary disability, when is the approximate date of recovery?).\n\nFor example, if a typist is required to type at least 50 words per minute, then typing 50 w.p.m. is an inherent requirement of this job. Having no physical disability or being without any illness may not necessarily be an inherent requirement of this job.\n\n \n\nApplying the above typist example, if you have a leg injury (but you can type at least 50 w.p.m.) and you are now handling this job, the employer will violate the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) if he/she dismisses you on the grounds that you cannot carry out the inherent requirements of the job.\n\n \n\n***How will I know if I can perform the inherent requirements of a job?***\n\n \n\nIn reality, a person with a physical disability can, like other people, take up many jobs. An employer should be able to tell you about the inherent requirements of the job. To help you find out, try to get a copy of the job description beforehand and study the list of duties and responsibilities. The job interview should also be used as an opportunity to ask more questions about the nature of the work involved.\n\n \n\n(A note to employers: If job applicants or existing employees cannot perform the inherent requirements of a particular job, employers must consider whether it is feasible to provide \"reasonable accommodation\" to help them perform the job duties. For more information on this matter, please go to [question 7](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/discrimination_due_to_disability/q7).)",

        "answer": "It may be lawful to discriminate against (including dismiss) an employee who has an infectious disease, if it is reasonably necessary for the protection of public health (i.e. to prevent the spreading of such disease to other colleagues or customers). However, it is generally NOT acceptable to dismiss a person or discriminate against them on this basis unless the job is such that there is a risk of spreading the disease through physical or bodily contact.\n\n \n\nUnder the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/), infectious diseases are the diseases set out in [Schedule 1](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/599/sch1.html) of the [Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/599/) (e.g. tuberculosis and viral hepatitis) and any communicable disease specified by the Director of Health in the Government Gazette.\n\n \n\nAccording to [section 61](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s61.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/), however **,** neither HIV infection nor AIDS is to be treated as an infectious disease. In that case, it may be unlawful to discriminate against an employee with AIDS.\n\n \n\nEmployers should also note that many infectious diseases can be cured after proper treatment. Therefore, the granting of sick leave is always an alternative to immediate dismissal.\n\n \n\nBefore dismissing an employee with an infectious disease, the employer must comply with the provisions of the [Employment Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/) (please refer to another topic – [Employment Disputes](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/employmentDisputes)) and should consult a lawyer if necessary.",

        "answer": "With reference to [Code of Practice on Employment under the DDO](http://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/graphicsfolder/showcontent.aspx?content=cops_ddo) (issued by the Equal Opportunities Commission), if a person with a disability can perform the [inherent requirements of the job](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/discrimination_due_to_disability/q2) with some adjustments, including the provision of certain services or facilities, employer is required to consider making such adjustments. Making adjustments that are required to ensure equal opportunities for people with a disability is commonly referred to as providing **reasonable accommodation**. Reasonable accommodation may be made at any stage of employment, according to the needs of the person with the disability.\n\n \n\nIf you are a person with a physical disability, you may frankly tell your employer that all people with a physical disability want to work independently and not to depend on the help of other colleagues. Your employer must try to provide reasonable accommodation in the workplace. For example, your employer can check the access to the building, the steps, the office corridors and toilets, to see whether these facilities need any alteration; he/she may install some special facilities for people with a disability; he/she may also provide you with flexi-hours in the office, so that you can perform the inherent requirements of the job.\n\n \n\nHowever, according to clause 11.8 of the [Code of Practice](http://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/graphicsfolder/showcontent.aspx?content=cops_ddo) and [section 12(2)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s12.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/), it may be lawful to discriminate against (e.g. refuse to employ or dismiss) a person with a disability if providing reasonable accommodation would impose **unjustifiable hardship** on the employer. That is to say, the person or organisation that provides the reasonable accommodation to the disabled person would suffer a lot as a result. The most typical examples of unjustifiable hardship are the poor financial circumstances of the employer, and the huge amount of expenditure (including recurrent expenditure) required to be made by the person or company claiming unjustifiable hardship.\n\n \n\nIt clearly may be difficult for persons/organisations with limited resources to spend a lot of money making adjustments in order to provide reasonable accommodation for an employee with a disability. The [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) allows the financial capacity of an organisation to be taken into account. For more information on this issue, please refer to clause 11.18 of the [Code of Practice](http://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/graphicsfolder/showcontent.aspx?content=cops_ddo) or [section 4](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s4.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/).\n\n \n\n(Note that the principles of reasonable accommodation and unjustifiable hardship apply to cases relating to physical disability as well as other kinds of disability.)\n\n \n\nIf a dispute is brought to court and the employer claims unjustifiable hardship in defence of not providing reasonable accommodation, the burden of proving the expense is not justifiable falls on the employer.\n\n \n\nIn short, an employer must not claim that a disabled person cannot perform the inherent requirements of a job without first considering the provision of reasonable accommodation, or treat that person less favourably than people without a physical disability.",

Taxi drivers may be violating the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) if they refuse to offer taxi services to disabled persons.\n\n \n\nThe Equal Opportunities Commission has published a document entitled \"Guidelines for Taxi Services\" and some of the important points contained are highlighted below:\n\n \n\n- If a mobility-impaired passenger has difficulty in boarding and alighting from the taxi independently, the driver should offer assistance to the passenger, and if necessary, help the passenger place properly in the taxi any wheelchair or other auxiliary aid(s). A driver who has difficulty in providing such assistance to a passenger should clearly explain his/her difficulty to the passenger.\n- To facilitate the boarding and alighting of taxis by persons with a disability in restricted zones, the Transport Department and the Hong Kong Council of Social Service have prepared a **\"Certificate for Picking Up or Setting Down of Passengers with Disabilities in Restricted Zones\"** for use by persons with a disability.

IF MY CHILD IS ADMITTED, DOES THE KINDERGARTEN HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE SPECIAL SERVICES OR FACILITIES TO HELP HIM WITH HIS STUDIES?",
        "answer": "As mentioned before, the definition of disability under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) includes the total or partial loss of a person's mental functions. This includes a mental handicap and thus you and your child are protected under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/).

The most important of these guidelines is that educational establishments should assess the competence of applicants with disabilities using the same standard that they use for applicants without disabilities. In addition, all applicants (with or without disabilities) should go through the same selection process. Educational establishments should avoid adopting separate forms or selection panels for applicants with disabilities, unless a need for special arrangements has been identified.\n\n \n\nIf your child is admitted, the kindergarten has the responsibility to provide some special services or facilities for him in order to help him study. However, the kindergarten may refuse to provide such services or facilities if they would impose unjustifiable hardship on the kindergarten. For example, it is lawful for the kindergarten not to provide extra classes or visual aids to help your child if the kindergarten does not have adequate human and financial resources to do so.\n\n \n\nFor a more detailed explanation of what can be considered \"unjustifiable hardship\", please refer to [clause 12.3 of the Code of Practice ](https://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/Upload/cop/ddo/cop_edu_e.htm)or [section 4](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s4.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/).",

        "answer": "The definition of disability under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) includes a disorder, illness or disease that affects a person's thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or that results in disturbed behaviour, and includes disabilities that previously existed but no longer exist. Thus, if you currently have a mental illness (or you used to have a mental illness but have now recovered), you are protected under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) as people with other types of disabilities.\n\n \n\nIn addition, the employment-related provisions under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) cover all employment matters including recruitment, training, promotion, employment terms, and dismissal. It may be unlawful for an employer to refuse to employ you, give you less favourable employment terms, or dismiss you on the grounds of mental illness.\n\n \n\nThe employer has to determine whether or not you can perform the [inherent requirements of the job](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/discrimination_due_to_disability/q2). If you cannot perform the inherent requirements of the job in question, the employer can refuse to employ you or dismiss you. However, under existing legislation, the employer has a duty to provide special services or facilities in order to help you perform the inherent job requirements as long as the provision of such services/facilities would not impose unjustifiable hardship (see [question 7](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/discrimination_due_to_disability/q7)) on that employer.\n\n \n\nAs long as the employee can perform the inherent requirements of the job, the employer cannot discriminate against that employee on the grounds of mental illness.",

        "answer": "Under the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/), such refusal is unlawful unless the provision of goods, services or facilities to people with mental or ex-mental illness will cause unjustifiable hardship (see [section 4](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s4.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/)) to the provider. [Section 27](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s27.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) has listed out some examples of goods, services and facilities covered by the legislation. Here is an example from daily life:\n\n \n\n- A restaurant that does not welcome diners who have a mental illness may be committing an unlawful act.\n\n   \n\n  It may also be unlawful for a service provider to discriminate with respect to the terms and conditions and the form of provision of goods, services or facilities. Therefore, if a restaurant permits people with mental illnesses to dine in it, but seats them on their own, away from other diners, this may also amount to discrimination.",

        "answer": "In a high risk workplace, the employer is obviously concerned about the health and safety of all employees. Nevertheless, this does not automatically rule out people with a visual impairment. There is sometimes an assumption that people with a visual impairment would be a danger to themselves and to others. This may not be true as it depends on the extent of the impairment and the nature and location of the work.\n\n \n\nThe same principles apply here in that the employer cannot refuse to employ you with the reason of your visual impairment alone.

        "answer": "It may be unlawful for an employer to dismiss you on the grounds of your chronic illness or the regular treatment for your illness. The [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) requires employers to first analysis whether an employee can perform the [inherent requirements of a job](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/discrimination_due_to_disability/q2).\n\n \n\nIf the illness is so serious that makes you unable to perform the inherent requirements of your job, your employer can dismiss you.

For example, the employer of an employee who has renal disease should consider allowing the employee in question to work flexible hours so as to receive proper dialysis treatment, unless this arrangement would seriously hinder his/her job.\n\n \n\nEmployers and employees must also note the provisions in the [Employment Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/) with regards to granting sick leave.

If the HIV test is irrelevant to the inherent requirements of the job, the employer has no right to such information and you can refuse to take the test.

If a bankrupt fails to attend an initial interview arranged by the Trustee/Official Receiver, the Court may make a non-commencement order so that the bankruptcy period will be extended in effect. They should also attend subsequent meetings with their creditors regarding the future arrangement of their assets and income and the administration of the bankruptcy estate.\n\n \n\nBankrupts should hand over all of their assets (both local and overseas) to the Official Receiver/Trustee and submit all documents related to their assets such as bank account statements or business account books, etc. They should also inform the Official Receiver/Trustee of all of their income and earnings. Bankrupts may commit a bankruptcy offence and be liable to imprisonment if they fraudulently remove or transfer any part of their personal properties.\n\n \n\nIf the bankrupts are also civil servants, then the Official Receiver will inform the departmental secretary of the relevant government department, the Civil Services Bureau and the Treasury. If the bankrupts work in banks, then their employer must be informed. If the bankrupts work in another part of the private sector, however, then the Official Receiver/Trustee will not approach their employers unless it is necessary for the collection or investigation of the bankrupts' financial information.\n\n \n\n**Things that should NOT be done**\n\n \n\nBankrupts should not make repayments directly to individual creditors without the approval of the Court and the Official Receiver/Trustee. They should stop using credit cards or applying for loans from financial institutions. They should also stop paying life insurance premiums.\n\n \n\nBankrupts will not be able to act as company directors and may not be able to practise in certain professions such as lawyer, estate agent or insurance agent, etc. They cannot purchase luxuries such as buying cars or travelling overseas unless they have reasonable grounds to do so.\n\n \n\nBankrupts may commit a bankruptcy offence and be liable to imprisonment if they try to quit Hong Kong and take with them personal assets that should be distributed among their creditors. Bankrupts may also be liable to imprisonment if they try to conceal or avoid receiving legal documents in the bankruptcy proceedings or cause any unnecessary delay in the proceedings.\n\n \n\nFor more details of bankruptcy offences, please refer to [question 11](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/bankruptcy_IndividualVoluntaryArrangement_Companies_Winding_up/bankruptcy/bankruptcy_Q&A/q11).",

        "question": "WHAT CAN THE CREDITORS DO AFTER THE GRANTING OF BANKRUPTCY ORDER?",
        "answer": "Any creditor of the bankrupt may request the Official Receiver to call for a general meeting of all the creditors to appoint a Trustee for the bankrupt's assets. If the total value of those assets is unlikely to exceed $200,000, then the Official Receiver or a person appointed by the Official Receiver will normally be appointed as the Trustee. Each creditor must complete a [Proof of Debt Form](https://www.oro.gov.hk/eng/our_services/pforms/bankruptcy_forms.html) with supporting documents to prove any debt contracted by the Bankrupt. The Proof of Debt Form should be submitted to the Official Receiver's Office.\n\n \n\nIf necessary, creditors can request the Official Receiver to apply to the Court for a public examination of the bankrupt in open court ([section 19](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/6/s19.html) of the [Bankruptcy Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/6/)).\n\n \n\nThe Official Receiver sometimes takes the view that the bankrupt has been un-cooperative, and that he is not making full and frank disclosure of his financial affairs. In such circumstances, the Official Receiver and the petitioner might have legitimate reasons to believe that a private examination would be beneficial to the administration of the assets in that more substantial and useful information might be obtained regarding the financial affairs of the bankrupt.\n\n \n\nUpon application by the Official Receiver, the court will decide if the case is appropriate for an order for private examination. If the answer is in the affirmative, the court is likely to order the bankrupt to attend before a Master of the High Court to be examined under [section 29](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/6/s29.html) of the [Bankruptcy Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/6/) at such time as directed by the court, with an estimated length of examination (e.g. 2 hours). The petitioner is to have the conduct of the examination by his solicitor or barrister.\n\n \n\nThe court may further order the bankrupt to provide to the petitioner all documents in his possession, custody or power relating to himself, his dealings or property within certain days of the order (e.g. 21 days).",

Take arrears of wages as an example, employees can recover wages up to a maximum of $8,000 each in respect of services rendered to their employer in preference. However, any arrears of wages, wages in lieu of notice or severance payments exceeding the statutory limits are non-preferential debts, and employees will be treated as ordinary creditors on claiming the exceeded amount.\n\n \n\nAlternatively, employees can apply for ex-gratia payments from the [Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund ](https://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/erb/content4.htm)through the Labour Department.

He should stop using credit cards or apply for loans from financial institutions. He should also cease payment of any life insurance premium. He cannot enjoy luxuries such as buying a car or travelling overseas unless he has reasonable grounds to do so.\n\n \n\nThe Official Receiver/Trustee will take control of Mr. T's assets and income. The Trustee or the representative of the Official Receiver has the right to inspect Mr. T's house if necessary. His provident fund (if any) will be considered as part of his assets (subject to the provisions of the relevant provident fund scheme).\n\n \n\nMr. T should hand over all of his assets (both local and overseas) to the Official Receiver/Trustee and submit all documents related to his assets such as bank account statements or the account books of his business, etc. He should also inform the Official Receiver/Trustee of all of his income/earnings.\n\n \n\nIf Mr. T owns a flat under the joint name of his wife, then his share may be realised for the repayment of his debts. If he owns any property outside of Hong Kong, then the Official Receiver/Trustee will require him to sell that property for the benefit of the creditors and to sign all necessary authorities, deeds and documents for such purpose. If Mr. T refuses to do so, then he may be punished for contempt of court.\n\n \n\nAfter the deduction of administrative expenses, the Official Receiver/Trustee will distribute Mr. T's assets (including his surplus income) to his creditors [by way of dividends](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary#b). However, Mr. T's family members will not be required to bear his indebtedness.\n\n \n\nWith regard to the matter of reasonable living expenses as mentioned above, the High Court has made the following ruling (as per the case of [*Re Lau Nga Yee Christine*](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2004/880.html)):\n\n \n\n- A person's \"reasonable domestic needs\" should be the same whatever the size of his debt. The mere fact that a large amount is due cannot somehow make a basic need less reasonable.\n- In principle the education of one's children can constitute a \"domestic need\" of the bankrupt and her family. The expense is \"domestic\" in the sense that the education of sons and daughters is a conventional incident of maintaining a family and home. It is a \"need\" in the sense that, especially in Hong Kong, the education (including the tertiary education) of one's offspring is regarded as an important parental and social responsibility, irrespective of any obligations imposed by the letter of the law.\n- In view of the bankrupt's genuine need to support her family, together with the special nature of her job, the Court (in the subject case) also allowed reasonable expenses in the following areas:\n  - expenses of a part-time domestic helper;\n  - emergency taxi fare (to deal with emergency duty calls from her employer, i.e. Hospital Authority);\n  - support for the bankrupt's parents (both nearly 80 years old, whilst the bankrupt's 2 siblings were also in financial difficulties);\n  - job-related expenses.",

        "question": "WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF AN IVA?(WITH A BRIEF PROCEDURAL GUIDE FOR APPLYING FOR AN IVA)",
        "answer": "You are recommended to consult a lawyer if you want to apply for an IVA.\n\n \n\n**The advantages of IVA**\n\n \n\n- An IVA is a voluntary agreement with your creditors. As such, there is far less stigma with an IVA agreement compared with bankruptcy. However, a record will still be kept by the Official Receiver's Office and is open to public search.\n- If you are made bankrupt, then all your assets will be vested in your Trustee. It is very likely that the Trustee will sell your major assets, in order to repay your debts. Unlike bankruptcy, however, you do not necessarily have to sell your home and other major assets under IVA agreements.\n- If you set up an IVA, your professional or employment status is less likely to be affected. By contrast, your professional career may be in jeopardy, if you are a bankrupt. In addition, you can continue to serve as a director in a company or run your own business, neither of which is allowed in bankruptcy.\n- There is a better chance for you to obtain credit after you have repaid your debts pursuant to an IVA agreement.\n- Legal proceedings for bankruptcy can involve considerable time and cost.\n- Creditors may expect better repayment from a debtor.\n\n**The disadvantages of IVA**\n\n \n\n- The period of an IVA is usually longer than that of bankruptcy (assuming the bankrupt co-operates fully with the Official Receiver/Trustee).\n- If there is no realistic prospect of an IVA, then you may still have to face a bankruptcy lawsuit (the relevant consequences are listed in the [previous section](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/bankruptcy_IndividualVoluntaryArrangement_Companies_Winding_up/bankruptcy/bankruptcy_generalInformation/)).\n\n**A brief summary of the procedures for applying for an IVA**\n\n \n\n1. The debtor must propose a person to act as the [Nominee](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary#n) to implement and monitor the IVA.\n\n2. The debtor must submit a proposal to the Nominee. The debtor can appoint a lawyer to prepare the documentation.\n\n3. The debtor must also submit a Statement of Affairs to the Nominee.\n\n4. Before the approval of the proposal by the creditors, the debtor should apply to the Court for an Interim Order (for a 14-day-period during which no bankruptcy or other legal proceedings can be taken or continued against the debtor without the permission of the Court). According to the [Bankruptcy (Fees & Percentages) Order](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/reg/6C/index.html) ( [Cap. 6C](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/reg/6C/index.html)), a court fee is charged and computed by the following rates on the gross amount of the proposal:\n    \n\n   a. $15 on every $1,000 or fraction of $1,000 up to $100,000 of the repayment amount; and \n   b. $7.50 on every $1,000 or fraction of $1,000 beyond $100,000 of the repayment amount.\n   Example:\n   If the gross amount of repayment stated in the proposal is $150,000, then the court fee would be: \n   $[15 x (100,000÷1,000)] + $[7.5 x (50,000÷1,000)] = $1,875.\n\n5. The Nominee must submit a report concerning the debtor's proposal to the Court, stating whether a creditors' meeting should be held. If the Court is satisfied that a meeting should be held, then it can extend the Interim Order so that the proposal can be considered by the creditors.\n\n6. During the creditors' meeting, there will be negotiations amongst the creditors and the debtor on the repayment matters. Approval or modification of the proposal requires the agreement of the majority of the creditors who totally hold in excess of 75% of the gross amount of the debts owed and who present in person or by proxy and vote on the resolution. Any modification of the proposal also requires the debtor's consent.\n\n7. If the proposal is approved, then it will bind all the relevant creditors whether or not they were present at the meeting. The Chairman of the meeting must submit a report to the Court within 7 days of the meeting. Within 28 days of submitting the report, the debtor, creditors, Nominee, Trustee or the Official Receiver (in case the IVA applicant is a bankrupt) may apply to the Court to challenge the decision of the meeting.\n\n**The role of the Court**\n\n \n\n[Section 20K](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/6/s20k.html) of the [Bankruptcy Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/6/s20k.html) provides that the nominee may apply to the Court for directions in relation to any particular matter arising under the voluntary arrangement. The whole provision applies only to implementation and supervision of approved voluntary arrangement.\n\n \n\nThe role of the Court is limited to giving directions on matters relating to implementation and supervision, although no provision is specifically made as to the nature of the order that the court may make. It seems that the section is limited to enabling the nominee to seek assistance of the Court for a situation which is not envisaged by the proposal itself and which, for whatever reason, cannot be determined by the nominee exercising his own professional judgment.",

In other words, the creditor may institute legal proceedings against the company in order to obtain a court judgment to ascertain the company's liability for the debt. If the company still fails to comply with a court judgement to repay the debt, the creditor may then proceed to enforce the judgement by filing a winding-up petition (or enforce it through other legal proceedings).",

We have managed to locate an investor but the capital injection the investor can provide is not sufficient to pay off all of the company's debts. What options are available to the company to avoid its being wound up?**",
        "answer": "The company may try to negotiate with the creditors in order to reach a compromise regarding the repayment of the debts, and see if the creditors can be persuaded to withdraw the petition.\n\n \n\nAlternatively, the company can propose a scheme of arrangement under [section 674](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/32/s166.html) of the [Companies Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/32/) (Cap.622). Upon application by the company, the creditors, or the liquidator (in the case where a winding-up order has been granted), the Court may order a meeting of all the relevant parties be held to discuss and negotiate the details of an arrangement for debt repayment. \n\n\nIf a [majority in number](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary) representing at least three-fourths in value of the creditors (who are voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting) agree to any compromise or arrangement, the compromise or arrangement shall be binding on all the creditors if it is also sanctioned by the court. Sometimes the approved arrangement may involve the re-organization or transfer of the company's share capital, or even the merging of 2 or more companies.\n\n \n\nThe above procedures are complex and are usually carried out with the assistance of lawyers and professional financial advisors.\n\n \n\nAnother note is that whilst it is in the power of the Court to adjourn (postpone) winding-up proceedings, in order to enable a scheme of arrangement to be put in place, any such adjournment would generally only be ordered in the absence of opposition from the petitioning creditor. Even then that should only be done in circumstances where the court can see that there would be a realistic probability for a scheme of arrangement to be approved and can be sure that no adverse consequence to the parties involved will be occasioned as a result of the order made.

        "answer": "You may consider the option of **voluntary winding-up**. The relevant procedures include:-\n\n \n\n1. A special resolution for voluntary winding-up to be passed by the shareholders.\n2. A notice of the resolution has to be advertised in the Government Gazette within 14 days of the passing of the resolution.\n3. The company has to call a meeting of creditors. The notice for the meeting has to be advertised in the Government Gazette and in Chinese and English newspapers.\n4. The directors of the company have to make a full statement of the position of the company’s affairs, together with a list of creditors and the estimated amount of their claims, to be laid before the meeting. Resolution (concerning the details of the winding-up matter or process) may be passed at the meeting.\n5. During the meeting, a liquidator may be nominated and appointed. Further, an inspection committee may be appointed to supervise the exercise of power by the liquidator.\n6. The liquidator will deal with the affairs of the company. The liquidator will call further meetings of the company or creditors each year to account for his acts concerning the winding-up.\n7. When the affairs of the company have been fully wound up, the liquidator will produce an account of the winding-up, and call a final meeting of the company and of the company’s creditors.\n\n \n\nIf no special resolution can be passed at a general meeting of shareholders, the board of directors may nevertheless pass a resolution that the company be wound up. The relevant resolution shall include the following contents:\n\n \n\n1. The company cannot because of its liabilities continue its business;\n2. The directors consider it necessary that the company be wound up;\n3. Why it is not reasonably practical to use other provisions of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance to wind up the company; and\n4. A meeting of the company and of its creditors will be summoned and held on a date not later than 28 days after the delivery of a declaration to the Registrar of Companies.\n\n \n\nA declaration recording such resolution has to be signed by a director and be delivered to the Registrar of Companies within seven days of the date of the resolution. Meetings of the company and of the creditors have to be summoned within 28 days of the delivery of such resolution to the Registrar of Companies. A provisional liquidator also has to be appointed upon the delivery of the declaration.\n\n \n\n**Due to the complexity of the above procedures, you are advised to consult a lawyer or other qualified professionals before commencing such actions.**",

If a bankruptcy or winding-up order has been granted against the employer, the employee is entitled to receive payments (in respect of wages, wages in lieu of notice and severance payments that fall under the statutory limits) out of the employer's assets in preference (with priority) to most other creditors.\n\n \n\nFor example, an employee (as a preferential creditor) can recover the arrears of wages up to a maximum of $8,000 in respect of services rendered to his/her employer.\n\n \n\nAny arrears of wages, wages in lieu of notice, or severance payments in excess of the statutory limits are considered “non-preferential debts”, and the employee will be treated as an ordinary creditor with respect to any amounts claimed in excess of the statutory limits .\n\n \n\nHowever, whether you will be paid even the amounts within the statutory limits will depend on the company's assets available.

Also, you may attend or even summon a general meeting of creditors so that you can participate in decisions concerning the distribution of the remaining property of the company.\n\n \n\nUnless the debt owed to you by the company is secured and the value of the assets covered by the security is sufficient to repay the debt, you are not guaranteed that you can recover all the money.\n\n \n\nUnsecured creditors may recover money only if there are funds remained in the assets of the company after the realizations of all the company’s assets (i.e. all the assets were sold and converted to cash) and the deduction of all fees and expenses incurred in the winding-up process.

        "answer": "Again, no matter whether you are a nominee director or not, no personal financial liability for the company’s debts has to be borne by you. However, a nominee director has the same duty to the company as a “real” director does.

        "question": "MY COMPANY IS IN HEAVY DEBT. SOME CREDITORS HAVE THREATENED TO PRESENT A WINDING-UP PETITION. I HAVE THEREFORE TRANSFERRED ALL THE COMPANY’S ASSETS TO MY WIFE. A PETITION WAS PRESENTED 2 MONTHS AFTER THE TRANSFER, AND A WINDING-UP ORDER WAS EVENTUALLY MADE. CAN ANYONE GO AFTER MY WIFE FOR THE ASSETS?",
        "answer": "Yes. Any transfers or dispositions of assets made by a company within 2 years before the commencement of winding up can be set aside (made invalid) if the company does not receive full value for the transfer or disposition. This is called a transaction undervalue. If the transfer or disposition is made more than 2 years and within 5 years of the commencement of winding up, it can still be set aside if the company was insolvent or had become insolvent after the transfer or disposition.\n\n \n\nHence, in this case, the transfer can be set aside. The liquidator will go after your wife for the assets.\n\n \n\nThe situation is the same if your company sold your company’s assets (e.g. a piece of land) to a third party at an undervalue within 2 years before the commencement of winding up.\n\n \n\nGenerally, the date of commencement of winding up is the date of filing of the petition for winding up if it is a case of a winding up by the court. In case of a voluntary winding up, the commencement date is the date of the resolution passed for winding up the company.",

        "question": "FURTHER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION, WHAT IF I ONLY ARRANGE PAYMENT TO ONE OF THE CREDITORS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF WINDING-UP PROCEEDINGS?",
        "answer": "Even though the person who received payment is your company's creditor, the transaction is still invalid if it is made within 6 months of the commencement of the winding up and with the intention to prefer a particular creditor. It is called a preferential payment. If the person who received the assets is an “associate” of a company (e.g. a director), the relevant period is 2 years prior to the commencement of winding-up.\n\n \n\nFor example, if your company owes you (as a director or shareholder) or your wife or your relatives money and arrange payment immediately before the commencement of winding up, it would be a preferential payment as there is a clear intention that the company will “prefer” to repay these creditors than the others.\n\n \n\nThe reason behind is that your company's assets should be realized and all the relevant proceeds should be used to: i) settle all the expenses incurred in the winding-up proceedings; and ii) share with all the creditors but not only the one that you “prefer” to pay for. In this case, the creditor (who received your money) may be ordered by the Court to refund the money back to your company.",

        "answer": "A possibility that the company might be able to make full repayment of its debts is not a sufficient ground on which to object to the petition. However, an application can be made to the Court for an adjournment of the winding-up proceedings so that appropriate arrangements can be made with the creditors. The Court has discretion as to whether the Company should be wound up, or there should be further negotiations between the company and its creditors before the granting of a winding-up order.\n\n \n\nSuppose the debtor company applies to the Court for dismissal or a stay of (suspend) Mr. C's petition on the ground of cross-claim against Mr. C. What then would be the chance of success by the debtor company? The answer would depend on the fact of each case. Generally, that company must establish a genuine cross-claim with substance in it. The amount of cross-claim itself must exceed the amount of the debt claimed by Mr. C against that company. Where both requirements are met, the court would exercise its discretion to dismiss or stay the petition in the absence of special circumstances.",

        "answer": "If a court judgment has been obtained and there is no appeal against the judgment or no attempt by the company to set aside the judgment (to make it invalid), there is generally no dispute over the debt. A winding-up petition may be presented 21 days after a written demand is sent. However, a number of matters should be considered beforehand:\n\n \n\n \n\n- Is it anticipated that the company is solvent (i.e. it has financial ability to pay the debt or part of it)? If \"yes\", will it be commercially wiser to seek an order from the Court to execute a judgement by some other enforcement mechanism? For example, to seize and sell the company's property forthwith through a court order.\n- If it is anticipated that the company is insolvent, and therefore it is unlikely that much of the debt can be repaid upon winding-up, will it be commercially wiser to negotiate with the company, or even with other creditors, in order to explore the possibility of reaching a compromise or an arrangement which may maximize the recovery?",

        "answer": "Yes. In this kind of situation, the usual grounds for winding-up are that the affairs of the company are being, or have been, conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicial to the interests of part of the members/shareholders ([Section 724](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/622/s724.html) of the [Companies Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/622/)) and it is just and equitable (fair and reasonable) for the company to be wound up ([Section 177(1)(f)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/32/s177.html) of the [Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/32/)).\n\n \n\nExamples of this are:\n\n1.

        "question": "FURTHER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION, CAN I PRESENT A WINDING-UP PETITION AGAINST “ABC TRADING COMPANY” IF IT HAS REFUSED TO REPAY A DEBT TO ME？",
        "answer": "The answer depends on whether “ABC Trading Company” is a limited company or not. Usually a limited company will include the word “Limited” or “Ltd” as part of its name. However, in the course of conducting business, a limited company may use a “trade name”, i.e. a name other than its “real name”. Therefore, your best course of action is to do a company search at the [Companies Registry ](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/public/services.htm)and a business registration search at the Inland Revenue Department in order to find out the full registered identity of the company in question, or the name of the limited company that owns the “trade name” (i.e. ABC Trading Company).\n\n \n\nIf you have clarified that “ABC Trading Company” is a limited company, then you can institute winding-up proceedings against it (by specifying its “real name”, such as ABC Trading Company Limited, in the winding-up petition). If “ABC Trading Company” is not a limited company then it cannot be subject to winding-up procedures.\n\n \n\nIf “ABC Trading Company” is not a limited company and is owned by an individual person (or several partners), you should commence [bankruptcy proceedings](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/bankruptcy_IndividualVoluntaryArrangement_Companies_Winding_up/bankruptcy/bankruptcy_generalInformation/) against that person(s). You can find out the details of a sole-proprietor or partners,  by doing a business registration search at the [Inland Revenue Department](http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/tax/bre.htm).",

        "question": "CAN I SETTLE THE DISPUTE WITHOUT GOING TO COURT?",
        "answer": "Court action should generally be your last resort. You should first consider other ways to settle your dispute.\n\n \n\nFor example, if a person owes you money, you may first write him a demand letter. In the demand letter, you should state how much money he owes you and what it is for, and give him a warning that if he does not repay you by the date you mention, you will take legal action against him. Sometimes this warning, in particular if given by your lawyer on your behalf, will be effective in getting the debtor to repay you and so you do not have to go to court to start a civil action. If your debtor is willing to repay but is not able to make a lump sum payment of all the money he owes, you may negotiate with him for settlement by instalments. You must keep a copy of the demand letter and any reply record from the debtor. In case you do eventually have to go to court, you may need to use them as evidence.\n\n \n\nThere are also some alternative channels which may help you settle disputes. For example, if you are facing a commercial dispute, you could possibly consider arbitration as an alternative to a civil court action *.* Please contact the [Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre](https://www.hkiac.org/) if you are interested in arbitration services. However, please note that before commencing the arbitration procedure, both parties must agree to solve the dispute by arbitration. For more details about arbitration, please click [here](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/hkLegalSystem/arbitration).\n\n \n\nAs from 2 April 2009, under the Civil Justice Reform, mediation was introduced as a voluntary resolution process. The aim is to encourage settlement and to achieve cost-effectiveness. The Court may now stay the Court proceedings to enable the parties to explore alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”). Mediation is the recommended ADR by the Court.\n\n \n\nIf you are facing an employment dispute, you may call the [Labour Relation Division](https://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/labour/content1.htm) of the Labour Department in order to obtain preliminary advice.",

        "question": "DO I HAVE SUFFICIENT LEGAL BASIS TO START A CIVIL ACTION? WILL IT BE POSSIBLE FOR MY OPPONENT TO SUE ME BACK IN RESPECT OF THE SAME CASE?",
        "answer": "Before you start a civil action, you should first consider whether or not you have a sound legal basis for a claim. Apart from considering the legal basis of your claim you should also bear in mind that sometimes both you and your opponent may have respectively committed some faults in relation to the same event. For example, let us say you have entered into a contract to sell some toy cars to your customer. Your customer did not pay you for any of the goods because some of the toy cars manufactured by you were defective. If you start a civil action against your customer to recover the price of the goods sold, your customer may \"counterclaim\" against you in the same civil action. Your customer might seek monetary compensation from you for any damages which he has suffered due to some of the toys cars which you supplied being defective. If this happens, you may have to face a prolonged lawsuit and may end up gaining nothing.\n\n \n\nTherefore, in order to ascertain whether you have any legal basis to start a civil action and in order to assess whether your opponent would have a valid \"counterclaim\" against you, you should seek legal advice before starting a civil action. You may also consider settling the dispute out of court in order to minimise the legal costs.",

For more information about this centre, please click [here](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/legalAid/freeOrSubsidisedLegalAssistanceInHongKong/resourceCentre).\n\n \n\nAs to legal representation in court proceedings, you can engage a legal practitioner in private practice to act on your behalf if you can afford the relevant legal costs. Otherwise, you can apply for legal aid under the **Legal Aid Scheme** . Legal aid will be granted if you pass the means test (your financial resources do not exceed the prescribed limit) and the merits test (there is legal basis for your claim).

        "answer": "Remember, even if you win your case and obtain a court judgment in your favour which awards you all sums which you have claimed, there is no guarantee that you will be able to recover all the sums that have been awarded by the court.\n\n \n\nBefore you start a legal action, it is important to consider at the outset whether or not the person, firm or company you are going to sue is likely to be able to pay you if you win the civil action. If they\n\n \n\n- are unemployed, bankrupt or wound up;\n- have no money of their own; no personal property and nothing else of value belonging to them (such as a car) which is not hired or subject to a hire purchase or lease agreement;\n- have ceased to trade;\n- have already been taken to court by others and have not paid; or\n- have other substantial debts to pay,\n\nyou may have little chance of getting your money even if you win a civil action.\n\n \n\nThe [Official Receiver's Office](http://www.oro.gov.hk/) at 10 th Floor, Queensway Government Offices, 66 Queensway, Hong Kong (Telephone no: 28672448) will be able to tell you whether a person is bankrupt, or whether a limited company is in compulsory liquidation/winding-up (meaning that the company has stopped trading and probably has neither money nor other assets). Limited companies can also be wound-up voluntarily. To check whether a company has been wound up voluntarily, you can contact the [Companies Registry](http://www.info.gov.hk/cr/enquiries/index.htm).\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, you may be able to get some money if you are prepared to accept small instalments over a period of time. You should therefore try to negotiate with your debtor (or the defaulting party) for payments by instalments first, before considering going to court.",

        "answer": "You will usually need to pay a fee to the court in order to start your claim. (However, if the person you are suing (the defendant) surrenders and pays you, you may recover this fee as well.)\n\n \n\nIf the defendant defends your claim, you may need witnesses to help tell the court what happened. You have to pay a deposit to the court for the witness expenses. You may also need to obtain a report from an expert (e.g. a doctor, mechanic or surveyor) and ask this expert to go to court to give evidence on your behalf. You will have to pay the expert's expenses and charges. (But if you win, the court may order the defendant to pay towards these.)\n\n \n\nIn addition, you have to bear your own expenses for going to court (for filing documents or attending hearings) and for travelling expenses and meals.\n\n \n\nIf you engage a lawyer to represent you, you will have to pay for the legal services rendered. You may ask the court to order the defendant to reimburse you if you win your case. But usually, you will only get a portion (about 70% on average) of your lawyer's fees and expenses.\n\n \n\nYou should also note that the court will not automatically take steps to ensure **What will happen if you are the losing party?**\n\n \n\nIf you are the losing party, you will normally be ordered to pay the costs (this generally means legal costs) to the winning party. It makes no difference if you are a litigant in person (without appointing a lawyer). The costs are the expenses that the winning party has had to spend on the preparation and hearing of the matter. These include the expenses for the lawyers representing the winning party (if any). The amount of these costs can be substantial, depending on the complexity of the case, the preparation work required and the length of the hearing. that the losing party pays the winning party.

If you lose your case, you would not be able to recover the sum which you have claimed nor would you be able to recover any legal costs or expenses that you have incurred in bringing your claim to court.

        "answer": "You have the right to act in person (i.e. to handle your case by yourself). Alternatively, you may instruct a lawyer to represent you and present your case to the court.\n\n \n\nYou should note that if your claim is brought in the Labour Tribunal or the Small Claims Tribunal, then no legal representation is permitted. Claims in the Labour Tribunal and the Small Claims Tribunal are generally more straightforward. However, in many other types of cases, the legal procedure involved can be considerably more complicated. For example, a personal injury claim involves matters like writing to the person you are claiming from to set out the details of your claim, exchanging evidence, trying to agree on the medical reports to be used, preparing witness statements for yourself and for those who saw your accident, etc. You will also need to make a realistic assessment of the amount of damages you are seeking. It may therefore be preferable to get some professional help and advice from a lawyer.\n\n \n\nYou should note that while court staff can assist you with enquiries on court procedures (e.g. what forms you need and how to fill them in), they will not provide any legal advice or offer any comment or assistance on the conduct of specific court cases and proceedings. Thus, if you want to know whether you have a good claim or whom you should sue, you have to consult your own lawyer.\n\n \n\nYou should also bear in mind that it is the duty of the parties to present their case to the court for its determination. The court itself does not investigate the case. In other words, the judge will be acting as an umpire and makes decisions after considering the evidence presented and hearing the arguments from all parties. You cannot expect the judge to give much assistance to a litigant presenting his case in person.\n\n \n\n**Where the parties are limited companies**\n\n \n\nFor cases which are heard in the Court of First Instance of the High Court, a limited company must engage a solicitor to attend the court hearing on its behalf unless leave (permission) is obtained from the court for it to be represented by one of its directors. The company's application for such leave has to be made to the Court Registrar and supported by an [affidavit or affirmation](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial/q2) made by the director concerned, stating and verifying the reasons. The company may rely on the reason that it is unable to afford to pay for the services of a solicitor or for some other good reasons. Apart from the relevant exhibits in support (i.e. supporting documents such as copies of the company's audited accounts and current bank accounts showing the up-to-date financial position), a board resolution of the company authorizing the director to appear on its behalf in the proceedings must be exhibited (attached) to the director's affidavit or affirmation. Whether to grant the leave or not is purely at the discretion of the Court Registrar. The company cannot appeal against the decision.\n\n \n\nIf the matter is heard in the **District Court** , a limited company may begin or carry on proceedings by one of its directors if the director has filed an affidavit or affirmation stating that he has been duly authorized by the board of directors to represent the company and exhibiting a copy of the board resolution duly certified by another director or the secretary of the company. In other words, the relevant company is not required to seek permission from the court (unlike a case in the High Court) if it has duly prepared the affidavit/affirmation together with the company's board resolution.",

If a demand letter is issued, the plaintiff must keep a copy of the demand letter as it will be one piece of evidence that the plaintiff will have to submit to the court later. If the defendant fails to comply with the requirements stipulated in the demand letter, or does not give any reply, the plaintiff may then go to the court to start a lawsuit.\n\n \n\nTo start a lawsuit, the plaintiff has to apply for the court to issue a document called a **writ of summons** or an **originating summons** , which then has to be served on (i.e. delivered to) the defendant. These two modes are the most common modes for commencing an action in the District Court or the Court of First Instance of the High Court. You can obtain the court forms for a writ of summons or an originating summons from the Registries of the High Court and the District Court, and from the [Resource Centre for Unrepresented Litigants](http://rcul.judiciary.hk/rc/cover.htm).\n\n \n\nFor more information about these two kinds of summons, please go to the [next question](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/start_civil_action/q8).",

        "question": "IF I WANT TO START A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST SOMEBODY THROUGH THE DISTRICT COURT OR THE HIGH COURT, SHOULD I COMMENCE THE ACTION BY FILING A WRIT OF SUMMONS OR BY FILING AN ORIGINATING SUMMONS?",
        "answer": "A **writ of summons** must be used to commence an action based on contract, [tort](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary), fraud, damages for personal injuries or death, damages to property arising out of a breach of duty, and generally for all actions which would involve a substantial dispute of facts (examples of such disputes include whether the defendant owes you money and how much; whether the defendant has damaged your goods/property; whether the defendant has failed to perform a contractual obligation). As you can see, the majority of civil actions are begun by a writ of summons.\n\n \n\nAn **originating summons** is usually suitable for cases where there is only little or no dispute of fact and the parties only raise issues of law, or the interpretation of certain terms in a legal document, for the court's determination. In other words, if the parties only have different interpretations on certain terms or wordings in a legal document (or the existing ordinance provisions) without having any dispute over the facts of the case, the legal action should be commenced by an originating summons. (Note: In case the court finds that there is a substantial dispute over facts, the court may order that the proceedings should proceed as if they were by way of a writ. The court may then give directions appropriate to the proceedings of a writ of summons.)\n\n \n\nIf you are still not sure whether your legal action should be commenced by a writ of summons or an originating summons, you should try to seek preliminary legal advice before submitting the documents to the court. If you cannot afford the legal costs, the [Free Legal Advice Scheme](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/legalAid/freeOrSubsidisedLegalAssistanceInHongKong/freeLegalAdviceScheme/) (run by the Duty Lawyer Service) or the [Bar Free Legal Service Scheme](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/legalAid/freeOrSubsidisedLegalAssistanceInHongKong/theBarFreeLegalServiceScheme/) (provided by the Hong Kong Bar Association) may offer preliminary legal advice to you.\n\n \n\nRegarding the procedure of a civil action commenced by a writ of summons, please go to [question 9](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/start_civil_action/q9).

        "answer": "**An overview of a civil action begun by writ of summons**\n\n \n\nThe following chart is made with reference to the website of the Resources Centre for Unrepresented Litigants, maintained by the Hong Kong Judiciary. It outlines the major steps involved in an action begun by a writ of summons.\n\n \n\n\n(Note: You should bear in mind that it can take a long time to complete the abovementioned steps to bring a civil case to trial and that most cases do not result in trial. Before a civil case is brought to trial, there may be court hearing(s), called [interlocutory proceedings](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial), held with the purpose of settling some procedural disputes, or dealing with urgent applications to preserve a party's rights. There are also various means of disposing of a civil action before trial.)\n\n \n\nBefore issuing the writ, the plaintiff should ascertain the name of the defendant and his last known address. If the defendant is a corporation/limited company, the plaintiff should make a [company search](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/public/services.htm) to obtain up to date information about its name and its registered office. If the defendant is a business (sole proprietorship or partnership), the plaintiff should conduct a [business registration search](http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/tax/bre.htm) at the Inland Revenue Department to ascertain the trade name and the principal place of business.\n\n \n\nSamples of **writs of summons** can be downloaded from the Judiciary website.

For cases in the District Court, please click [here](https://www.judiciary.hk/doc/en/court_services_facilities/dc/dc_form1.doc).\n\n \n\nWhen issuing the writ of summons, the plaintiff has to set out in Chinese or English an **endorsement of claim** (a concise statement of the nature of the claim) or a **statement of claim** giving details of the legal basis of the claim together with the facts that the plaintiff is relying on, and the relief and remedy that he is claiming. (Note: If the plaintiff wants to wait and see whether the defendant intends to contest the case, he may only prepare the endorsement of claim when issuing the writ. If the plaintiff only attaches an endorsement of claim into the writ, a statement of claim has to be filed and served on the defendant within 14 days after the defendant has acknowledged service of the writ and given notice of intention to defend.)\n\n \n\nPlease click [here](http://rcul.judiciary.hk/rc/eng/sform.jsp) to obtain guidelines (given by the Resource Centre for Unrepresented Litigants) for preparing a statement of claim and to get some sample statements of claim.\n\n \n\nThe writ of summons has to be issued and filed with the court at the Registry. (Note: You have to pay a filing fee at the Accounts Office of the court upon filing the writ. To check the exact amount of the filing fee, please contact [the relevant Court Registry](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/about_us/business_hours.html).)\n\n \n\n**Service of the writ of summons (delivering the writ to the defendant)**\n\n \n\nEvery writ must be accompanied by three copies of the acknowledgment of service form. It is the plaintiff’s responsibility to serve the writ of summons and the accompanying three copies of the acknowledgment of service form on the defendant.\n\n \n\nSamples of the acknowledgment of service form can be downloaded from the Judiciary website.

For cases in the District Court, please click [here](https://www.judiciary.hk/doc/en/court_services_facilities/dc/dc_asws.doc).\n\n \n\nGenerally speaking, there are three alternative ways to serve a writ of summons on a defendant who is in Hong Kong, namely:\n\n \n\n1. by personal service: handing a \"sealed copy\" (i.e. sealed with the court's seal) of the writ of summons to (or leaving it with) the defendant personally;\n2. by registered mail: posting a sealed copy of the writ of summons by registered post addressed to the defendant at his usual or last known address; or\n3. by insertion through letter box: inserting a sealed copy of the writ of summons enclosed in a sealed (not open) envelope addressed to the defendant through his letter box.\n\n \n\nRemarks:\n\n \n\n- If the defendant is a limited company, the plaintiff can serve the writ of summons by posting it to, or leaving it at, its registered office.\n- If the defendant is a partnership business, the plaintiff may serve the writ of summons on any one or more of the partners or on any person having control or management of the business at its principal place of business. Alternatively, the plaintiff may send the writ of summons to of the principal place of business by registered post.\n- In an action for recovery of possession of land/flat, the plaintiff must also post a copy of the writ of summons at the entrance of the premises in question.\n- Under normal circumstances, the plaintiff cannot serve a writ of summons on a defendant outside Hong Kong unless he has obtained the permission of the court. The plaintiff should apply for permission before serving the writ of summons outside Hong Kong . For details of this application, please refer to [Order 11](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/s11.html) of the [Rules of the High Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) ([Cap. 4A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) of the Laws of Hong Kong) or [Order 11](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/s11.html) of the [Rules of the District Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/) ([Cap.336H](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/)) as appropriate.\n\n \n\nPlease also note that the plaintiff has to prove by affidavit or affirmation that the writ of summons has been served on the defendant. In the affidavit or affirmation, the plaintiff has to state that he has personally served the sealed copy of the writ of summons on the defendant on a specific date (including the day of the week). If the service was by post or by insertion through the letter box, the affidavit or affirmation has to state that the writ of summons has not been returned through the post (as the case may be) and that it will have come to the defendant's knowledge within 7 days thereafter. (Note: If the plaintiff has an agent/representative to serve the writ, that agent/representative has to make such an affidavit or affirmation.)\n\n \n\nFor more information about the service of a writ of summons within Hong Kong , and a sample affidavit/affirmation for service, please click [here](http://rcul.judiciary.hk/rc/eng/sform.jsp).\n\n \n\n**What happens after the plaintiff has served the writ of summons?**\n\n \n\nAfter the plaintiff serves the writ of summons on the defendant, the defendant will have a period of 14 days to acknowledge receipt of the writ of summons. To find out how this 14 days' period is calculated, you should refer to the question of [\"How to calculate the period of 14 days for filing of the acknowledgment of service form\"](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/against_civil_action/q1).\n\n \n\nIf the writ of summons was served with an endorsement of claim (without a statement of claim), then within 14 days after the date on which the defendant files the acknowledgment of service form indicating an intention to defend the civil action, the plaintiff will have to file and deliver to the defendant a statement of claim setting out the details of the legal basis of the claim together with the facts that the plaintiff is relying on and the relief and remedy that he is claiming.\n\n \n\nIf the writ of summons was served with a statement of claim, and the defendant files an acknowledgment of service form indicating that he wishes to contest the civil action, then within 28 days following the expiry of the time limit for the defendant to file an acknowledgment of service, the defendant should file and serve on the plaintiff his defence to the plaintiff's claim and a counterclaim against the plaintiff (if any). See the question of [\"What should I do if I decide to defend the case?\"](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/against_civil_action/q4)\n\n \n\nIf the defendant does not file an acknowledgment of service form or a defence within the time limit, the plaintiff can apply for a court judgment to be entered against the defendant. See the question of [\"What happens if the defendant does not file an acknowledgment of service form or a defence?\"](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/against_civil_action/q5)\n\n \n\nIf the defendant files a defence (and counterclaim), the plaintiff may need to file a reply (and defence to counterclaim, if any). See the question of [\"What happens if the defendant files a defence (and counterclaim)?\"](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/against_civil_action/q6)\n\n \n\n**What should the plaintiff know about \"payment into court\"?**\n\n \n\nPayment into court is one of the most valuable weapons in the armoury of the person being sued by you (i.e. the defendant). For more information on this, you should refer to the question of [\"If the defendant considers that he does in fact owe the plaintiff some money, what action can be taken by the defendant?\"](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/against_civil_action/q7)",

        "answer": "Set out below is some basic information regarding civil actions commenced by an originating summons. Due to the complexity of the procedures, you are strongly recommended to appoint a lawyer to represent you.\n\n \n\n**An overview of a civil action begun by an originating summons**\n\n \n\nThe following chart is made with reference to the website of the Judiciary's Resources Centre for Unrepresented Litigants. It shows the major steps for an action begun by way of an originating summons.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n**i. Filing of an Originating Summons by the plaintiff**\n\n \n\nThe plaintiff should set out in the originating summons a concise statement of the questions which the plaintiff seeks the court to decide or answer, or, a statement of the relief or remedy claimed (where appropriate). The originating summons should also contain sufficient particulars to identify the [cause of action ](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary)in respect of which he claims the relief or remedy.\n\n \n\nThe procedures for filing and serving an originating summons are similar to those for filing and serving a writ of summons. For details, please go back to [question 9](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/start_civil_action/q9).\n\n \n\n\n\n**ii. Filing of acknowledgment of service by the defendant**\n\n \n\nA defendant who has been served with an originating summons must acknowledge service of the summons as if it were a writ.\n\n \n\nIf the defendant does not file an acknowledgment of service form within the required time, or if in the acknowledgment of service form the defendant states that the proceedings are not contested, the plaintiff still has to proceed to court to have the matter heard. The court will give relief to the plaintiff if it is satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.\n\n \n\n\n\n**iii. Plaintiff's affidavit/affirmation**\n\n \n\nIf the defendant has filed an acknowledgment of service, the plaintiff's originating summons should be supported by an affidavit or affirmation of evidence. In that case, the plaintiff has to file an affidavit or affirmation in support of the originating summons within 14 days after the defendant has acknowledged its service. Explanatory notes for preparing an affidavit or affirmation and a sample affidavit / affirmation can be obtained from the [website of the Resource Centre for Unrepresented Litigants](http://rcul.judiciary.hk/rc/eng/sform.jsp).\n\n \n\n\n\n**iv. Defendant's affidavit/affirmation**\n\n \n\nWhere a defendant who has acknowledged service wishes to submit evidence, he must, within 28 days after service on him of the plaintiff's affidavit or affirmation, file his own affidavit or affirmation. Please refer to point (iii) above for guidelines on how to prepare an affidavit/affirmation.\n\n \n\n\n\n**v. Plaintiff's affidavit/affirmation in reply**\n\n \n\nIf the defendant serves an opposing affidavit or affirmation on the plaintiff, the plaintiff may within 14 days of such service file a further affidavit or affirmation to reply to the defendant's affidavit or affirmation. No further evidence can be filed unless special leave (permission) is granted by the court.\n\n \n\nThe defendant may make a counterclaim in the same proceedings instead of bringing a separate action.\n\n \n\n\n\n**vi. At the hearing**\n\n \n\nAt the hearing, the plaintiff will make his submission first (i.e. telling his arguments to the court), followed by the defendant's submission in opposition. The plaintiff has the right of final reply. The court will either make a decision after the hearing or reserve it to be given later.\n\n \n\n(Note: Unless the court makes an order that the persons who have made the affidavits or affirmations have to attend court for cross-examination, they are not required to attend court at the hearing. If the court has made such an order, these persons must attend court to be cross-examined. The procedure will be similar to the trial of an action commenced by a writ of summons.

PREPARING A CASE FOR A COURT TRIAL\n\nAfter the parties file the statement of claim, defence (and counterclaim, if any) and reply (and defence to counterclaim, if any), the parties will have to tender their evidence to the court in order to prove their case.\n\n \n\nIn a civil action, the burden of proof rests on the party who asserts the fact (i.e. the party who makes an allegation must prove it). In that case, not only the plaintiff but also the defendant will have the burden to prove his allegations if the defendant counterclaims that the plaintiff is liable for the subject matter. The standard of proof is \"on the [balance of probabilities](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary)\".\n\n \n\nWhich facts are at issue at the trial depends partly on substantive law and partly on the contents of the documents which have already been filed with the court (including the statement of claim, defence and counterclaim (if any)). This is because the parties may have already admitted to some facts relevant to the case in those documents.\n\n \n\nThe party who bears the burden of proof can prove the facts in various ways, including oral evidence from witnesses, documents, photographs, audio or videotapes, or electronic data contained in any tapes or discs, etc. It is always advisable to obtain all the evidence at an early stage in the proceedings (and possibly before the commencement of the trial). All these forms of proof will be tendered before the court at the trial.\n\n \n\nIn a civil action, any evidence which is relevant to the disputes at issue, and which a party intends to rely on at the trial, will have to be disclosed to the other parties to the civil action prior to the trial. The process whereby documentary evidence is disclosed is called **discovery** and the process in which oral factual evidence is disclosed is called **exchange of witness statements** (please refer to question 1 and question 2).",

        "question": "HOW TO FIX A TRIAL DATE AND WHAT MAY HAPPEN AT A TRIAL",
        "answer": "Generally, applications for leave to set down civil causes for trial are made at the Case Management Conference (CMC). If a trial date is sought, each party should file and serve together with his Listing Questionnaire a certificate giving time estimate (without taking into account the time estimates of other parties) of his own opening submission, evidence-in-chief of each of his own witnesses, cross examination of each of the other side’s witnesses and his own closing submission. The certificate should preferably be prepared by the trial counsel.\n\n \n\nAt the CMC, if the Listing Master or Judge is satisfied that the parties are ready for trial, he will grant permission for fixing a trial date, and give directions regarding the manner for trial including the list on which the trial date will be fixed: the **Fixture List** or the **Running List**. Cases with an estimated length of trial of 3 days or less will be assigned to and set down in the Running List. An action will only be assigned to the Fixture List where the Master or Judge is satisfied that by reason of the estimated length of trial or for other good cause the action is appropriate to that List.\n\n \n\nIn appropriate cases, the Listing Master or Judge may also fix a date for a pre-trial review. The pre-trial review is generally dealt with by the trial judge, where he will, among other things, fix the starting date if a trial period has been fixed, confirm or vary the estimated length of the trial and give further directions. Where fixed, the pre-trial review is usually held about 8-10 weeks in advance of a trial.\n\n \n\nThe plaintiff should then file with the court an application to set a case down for trial. When filing the application to set the case down for trial, a prescribed fee has to be paid. In addition, a bundle of documents have to be lodged (see [Order 34 rule 3](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/reg/4A/s34) of the [Rules of the High Court](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/reg/4A) for the requirements of making this bundle). The form of application to set a case down for trial is prescribed by [Appendix D](https://legalref.judiciary.hk/doc/pd/eng/PD5.2_files/PD5.2_App_D.doc) to [Practice Direction 5.2](https://www.hklii.hk/en/other/pd/PD5.2). A party to an action who set it down for trial must also notify the other parties to the action that he has done so within 24 hours.\n\n \n\nWhen granting leave to set down for trial in the **Fixture List**, the Master or Judge may fix the trial date or a trial period or direct the parties to attend before the Clerk of Court on a specified date to fix the date(s) for trial. In listing the trial date, the court will take account of the availability of the parties, their counsel and witnesses.\n\n \n\nFor cases in the **Running List**, no fixed date will be offered for the trial. Once the title of the action has been fixed, its action number will appear at the bottom of the Pending List (a list of cases pending trial by the court) if it is expected that it will be tried during the next succeeding month. Parties must therefore check the Pending List regularly to see if their case has been listed yet.\n\n \n\nCases will be tried by judges who are found available to try them, generally in accordance with the order set out on the Pending List. Every Wednesday, a number of cases listed on the Pending List will be warned that they are likely to be called and tried during the next week. These cases are put on a separate list called the Warned List (please go to the [Judiciary webpage](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_lists/warned_list.html) if you want to see this list).\n\n \n\nIf the case has been put on the Warned List, the parties concerned are required to check this List every day to see if their case has been fixed to be tried on the next day. The Warned List is posted on the Notice Board outside the Clerk of Court's office and the Pending List is posted on the Notice Board in the Reception area of the Clerk of Court's Office on the Ground Floor. At 2:30 pm in every afternoon, the Listing Clerk will mark on the Warned List those cases that will be tried the next day, specifying the place and the time where and when the case will be tried. It is the responsibility of the parties concerned to ensure that they attend the trial on time.",

        "question": "WHAT CAN I DO IF I LOSE THE CASE (HOW TO APPEAL)?",
        "answer": "A party (either the plaintiff or the defendant) in a civil case who is not satisfied with a decision of a judge in the District Court can apply to that judge for leave (permission) to appeal. The party must do so **within 28 days** from the date on which the judgment or order of the Court was sealed or otherwise finalized. If the judge refuses to grant the permission to appeal, the party may apply to the Court of Appeal for that permission. The application must be made within 14 days from the date of the judge's refusal.\n\n \n\nNo prior permission to appeal is required for cases which were previously heard in the Court of First Instance of the High Court (except for appeals concerned solely with the question of legal costs). The appeal must be lodged **within 28 days** from the date on which the judgment or order of the Court was sealed or otherwise finalized.\n\n \n\nAfter permission is granted, or when there is a right of appeal without the need to seek prior permission, the appellant (i.e. the party making the appeal) should:\n\n \n\n- file a Notice of Appeal (a [sample notice](https://www.judiciary.hk/doc/en/court_services_facilities/hc/appeal_notice_of_appeal_cacv.doc) can be downloaded from the Judiciary website) with the trial court and at the same time serve a copy of the Notice on the other party (the appellant should try to deliver this Notice to the other party by hand);\n- lodge with the Registrar a sealed copy (bearing a court's chop) of the judgment or order appealed from and two copies of the Notice of Appeal, one of which shall be endorsed with the amount of the court fee paid, and the other endorsed with a date of service of the notice;\n- Notice of setting down (fixing the hearing date) must be given to all parties on whom the Notice of Appeal was served within 4 days after an appeal has been set down; and\n- make an application to fix a date for the hearing of an appeal to the Registrar of Civil Appeals ([application forms](https://www.judiciary.hk/doc/en/court_services_facilities/hc/ca_form_application_to_fix_a_date_for_the_hearing_of_the_appeal.doc) are available at the Clerk of Court's Office in the High Court). The application to fix a date for the hearing of an appeal should also include the appellant's estimate as to the length of the hearing. If the appellant does not apply to fix a date for the hearing of an appeal within a reasonable time, the respondent (i.e. the party opposing the appeal) may make such an application.\n\nAfter application has been made to fix a date for the hearing of an appeal, the Registrar of Civil Appeals will instruct the Clerk of Court to fix a date for the hearing. The parties will be notified in writing.\n\n \n\nCases are heard by **the Court of Appeal** , comprising normally three, sometimes two, Justices of Appeal.\n\n \n\nAn appeal to the Court of Appeal is by way of a rehearing. This means that the Court will rehear the case based on the documents. It considers the materials which were before the judge below (i.e. the judge of the lower court in which the case was first heard) and decides whether the judgment being appealed against is wrong.\n\n \n\nBut normally speaking, the witnesses who had given oral evidence in the previous trial will not be called back to give their evidence again at the appeal hearing.\n\n \n\nIn the hearing of an appeal to the Court of Appeal, the appellant addresses the court first, followed by the respondent. The appellant has the right to reply to the respondent's arguments.\n\n \n\nAfter hearing arguments from both parties, the Court of Appeal will pass a judgment either immediately after the hearing on a later date. The losing party will normally be ordered to pay the winning party's legal costs in the appeal (and possibly the costs for the previous trial).\n\n \n\nIt should be noted that comprehensive directions for the conduct of the civil business of the Court of Appeal are provided in [Practice Direction 4.1 (Civil Appeals to the Court of Appeal)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/other/pd/PD4.1.html).\n\n \n\n**Generally, appeals involve further arguments on the relevant legal points and a layman is not in a position to handle that type of argument. You should try to appoint a lawyer to deal with your appeal case.**",

        "question": "CAN I RECOVER ALL MY LEGAL COSTS IF THE COURT ORDERS ANOTHER PARTY TO PAY MY LEGAL COSTS?",
        "answer": "After a hearing or a trial, the court may make an order of costs in favour of the plaintiff or the defendant. Normally, the winning party will be awarded costs (i.e. the costs of the winning party will be paid by the losing party). In the context of litigation, the meaning of \"costs\" covers fees, charges, disbursements, expenses and remuneration incurred for the court hearing or trial.\n\n \n\nThe party in whose favour the costs order is made is called the **Receiving Party** . The party who has to bear costs is called the **Paying Party** . If the Paying Party is not willing to pay or disputes the amount of costs claimed, the Receiving Party can proceed to taxation of the relevant bill of costs.\n\n \n\n(Note: The word \"taxation\" has a special legal meaning in relation to the litigants' costs. It generally means the assessment of the amount of legal costs by the court. For further details, see question 1 below.)\n\n \n\nIt is open to the parties to agree on the amount of costs without resorting to assessment by the court. Indeed, they should first try to do so as assessment of costs by the court will involve extra costs for drafting a bill of costs, preparation for the assessment hearing, attendance in court and taxing fees.",

        "question": "HOW TO ENFORCE A COURT JUDGMENT AFTER WINNING THE CASE",
        "answer": "A litigant who obtains a court judgment against the other party does not automatically obtain the remedy (e.g. compensation) sought in the legal proceedings. This is because the court never enforces a judgment for the winning party on its own initiative. It is always for the winning party to decide when and how it would be best to enforce it. Different methods are used for different forms of assets.\n\n \n\nIf the court judgment is related to debt recovery or monetary compensation, the party who is ordered to pay according to that judgment is called the \"**judgment debtor** \", and the party who is entitled to enforce execution under the judgment is called the \"**judgment creditor** \".\n\n \n\nThe following questions and answers only highlight the usual options available for enforcing a court judgement. If you are the plaintiff or the judgment creditor, you must consult a lawyer before adopting any of these options.",

        "answer": "**Timing**\n\n \n\nJudicial review proceedings must be brought promptly and in any case within 3 months of the date when grounds for the application first arose. In other words, if you want to apply for a review of a particular administrative decision, you must start your legal action within 3 months from the date when the decision was made.\n\n \n\n**Leave (permission to apply for the review)**\n\n \n\nAn application for judicial review is by way of a two-stage process. You, as the applicant, must first obtain leave from the Court of First Instance of the High Court to bring an application for judicial review. If the court grants leave, you can then proceed with the substantive application.\n\n \n\n**Relief (solutions or ways to settle the dispute)**\n\n \n\nIn your \"Notice of application for leave to apply for Judicial Review\" (Form 86A), it is important to state clearly the relief that you seek by way of judicial review. (You can read the notes for guidance and get a sample of Form 86A from the [website of the Resource Centre for Unrepresented Litigants](http://rcul.judiciary.hk/rc/eng/goSearch.jsp).)\n\n \n\nThe relief sought may include one or more of the following:\n\n \n\n(a) Mandamus\n\n \n\nThis is an order compelling the respondent to perform an act specified in the order of the court, which is in the nature of a public duty or obligation. The act or obligation has to be specified in the application.\n\n \n\n(b) Certiorari\n\n \n\nThis is an order to quash or set aside a decision already made by the respondent.\n\n \n\n(c) Prohibition\n\n \n\nThis is an order to prevent the respondent from acting or continuing to act in excess of his power or to act against the rules of natural justice.\n\n \n\n(d) Declaration\n\n \n\nThis is an order declaring the legal rights and duties of the parties.\n\n \n\n(e) Injunction\n\n \n\nThis is an order restraining any person from acting in an office in which he is not entitled to act.\n\n \n\n(f) Damages (compensation)\n\n \n\nDamages may be claimed as relief in addition to other remedies. You cannot commence judicial review proceedings solely in order to seek damages.\n\n \n\n(g) Interim (temporary/provisional) relief\n\n \n\nThe court may make interim orders before the substantive application for judicial review is decided.

        "question": "HOW CAN I KNOW IF THE JUDGMENT DEBTOR HAS THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SATISFY THE COURT JUDGMENT AND TO PAY THE DEBT?",
        "answer": "If you are the judgment creditor, it may be that you know little about the judgment debtor's assets. Without further information, you will not be able to make the best choice regarding the available methods of enforcement.\n\n \n\nBy virtue of the provisions of [Order 48](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/s48.html) or [Order 49B](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/s49b.html) of the [Rules of the High Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) (see also [Order 48](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/s48.html) or [Order 49B](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/s49b.html) of the [Rules of the District Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/) as appropriate), a judgment debtor can be called to the court to answer questions about his assets.\n\n \n\nOne significant difference between Order 48 and Order 49B is that while the former specifically allows the examination of a corporation's officers, there is no corresponding provision in the latter.\n\n \n\nHowever, the Order 49B procedure has two advantages: (i) the judgment debtor can be arrested before the examination to secure his attendance in court; and (ii) the court has wider powers to order disclosure of assets by the judgment debtor.\n\n \n\n**Examination of the judgment debtor under Order 48**\n\n \n\nThe court may, on your ex parte application (without giving notice to the debtor) with a supporting [affidavit or affirmation](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial/q2), order the judgment debtor to attend before the Registrar or such officer as the court may appoint and be orally examined on the following questions:\n\n \n\n- whether any and, if so, what debts are owing to the judgment debtor by other persons; and\n- whether the judgment debtor has any and, if so, what other property or financial resources that could be used for satisfying the judgment or order in your favour.\n\n(If the judgment debtor is a limited company, the order can be made against a senior officer of the company.)\n\n \n\nThe court may also order the judgment debtor or officer to produce any documents in the judgment debtor's possession relevant to the questions mentioned above at the time and place appointed for the examination.\n\n \n\nThe order for examination must be delivered by hand to the judgment debtor and to any senior officer of a body corporate ordered to attend for examination. The judgment debtor's failure to attend the examination may lead to an order for imprisonment.\n\n \n\n**Examination of the judgment debtor under Order 49B**\n\n \n\nWhere a judgment for the payment of a specified sum of money is unsatisfied (either wholly or partly), the court, on your ex parte application, may order the examination of the judgment debtor on his assets, liabilities, income and expenditure and of the disposal of any assets or income.\n\n \n\nFor the purpose of securing the attendance of the judgment debtor at the examination, the court may order the judgment debtor to appear before the court at a time appointed by it, with such documents or records as it may specify. Such an order must be delivered to the judgment debtor by hand.\n\n \n\nIf, from all the circumstances of the case (including the judgment debtor's conduct), it appears to the court that there is reasonable cause to believe that an order to appear before the court for examination may be ineffective to secure the judgment debtor’s attendance, the court may order that the judgment debtor be arrested and be brought before the court on the day following the day of arrest.\n\n \n\nIt should be noted that, on an application for the above examination by the judgment creditor, the court has the power to make an order prohibiting the judgment debtor from leaving Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nWhere a judgment debtor fails to appear as ordered, the court may order that he be arrested and brought before the court for examination on the day following the day of arrest.\n\n \n\n**The power of the court after examining the judgment debtor**\n\n \n\nFollowing the examination conducted under either Order 48 or Order 49B,\n\n \n\n(NB If the judgment debtor fails to comply with such an order, you may apply to the court, on not less than 2 clear days notice to the judgment debtor, for an order for the imprisonment of the judgment debtor. Unless the judgment debtor shows good reason to object, the court may order the imprisonment of the judgment debtor for a period not exceeding 3 months.)\n\n1. if the court is satisfied that the judgment debtor:\n\n   - is able to satisfy the judgment, wholly or partly, but did not do so; or\n\n   - has disposed of assets with a view to avoiding satisfaction of the judgment or the liability which is the subject of the judgment, wholly or partly; or\n\n   - has wilfully failed to make a full disclosure as required or to answer any question,\n\n     it may, in its discretion, order the imprisonment of the judgment debtor for a period not exceeding 3 months.\n\n2. if the court is satisfied that the judgment debtor is able or will be able to satisfy the judgment, wholly or partly, by instalments or otherwise, it may order him to satisfy the judgment in such manner as it thinks fit.",

        "question": "HOW CAN I PREVENT THE JUDGMENT DEBTOR FROM LEAVING HONG KONG AS A WAY TO ESCAPE LIABILITY FOR PAYING THE JUDGMENT DEBT?",
        "answer": "You may apply for a prohibition order. It is an order prohibiting the judgment debtor from leaving Hong Kong to facilitate the chasing of the judgment debt.\n\n \n\nThe application may be made ex parte (without giving notice to the debtor). There should be an [affidavit or affirmation](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial/q2) in support. In relation to a judgment for the payment of a specified sum of money, the supporting affidavit or affirmation should recite and attach the judgment (and whether any part of it has been paid), and explain with relation to the case facts that a prohibition order is required to facilitate the enforcement of the judgment.\n\n \n\nRegarding a judgment or order for the payment of an amount to be assessed, or requiring the delivery of any property or the performance of any other act, the supporting affidavit or affirmation must show probable cause for believing that the judgment debtor is about to leave Hong Kong, and satisfaction of the judgment or order is thereby likely to be obstructed or delayed.\n\n \n\nThe court may make a prohibition order subject to such conditions as it thinks fit, including the condition that the order shall have no effect if the judgment debtor satisfies the judgment (pays all the money required). The form used for this order is [Form No 106 in Appendix A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/appA.html) of the [Rules of the High Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) or [Form No 106 in Appendix A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/appA.html) of the [Rules of the District Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/) as appropriate.\n\n \n\nA copy of any prohibition order must be delivered to the Director of Immigration, the Commissioner of Police and the judgment debtor (if he can be found). If a judgment debtor who has received a copy of the order or has otherwise been informed of its effect attempts to leave Hong Kong in contravention of that order, he may be arrested by any immigration officer, police officer or bailiff.\n\n \n\nThe judgment debtor who is prohibited by a prohibition order from leaving Hong Kong may, on 2 days clear notice to you and upon being present in person in court, apply for the order to be discharged. In such an application, the court may, after the assessment of the amount due to you, discharge the order (if appropriate). The case will then be proceeded as if the judgment debtor appears under arrest for examination under Order 49B (please see [question 1](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/enforce_judgment/q1) for details of Order 49B).\n\n \n\nA prohibition order lapses after one month but the court may, on your application, extend or renew the order for a period which does not exceed, with the initial period of one month and any other period of extension or renewal, 3 months. The order also lapses when you notify the Director of Immigration that the order is no longer required, and file a notice advising that the order is no longer required with the relevant Court Registrar. (Note: You must serve and file the notice as soon as reasonably possible after the order is no longer required.)",

        "question": "HOW CAN THE BAILIFF'S OFFICE ASSIST ME TO RECOVER MY DEBT/COMPENSATION/PREMISES FROM THE JUDGMENT DEBTOR/DEFENDANT?",
        "answer": "Bailiffs can execute the orders and judgments of a court or tribunal.\n\n \n\nFor example, if the judgment debtor refuses to pay the money, or the person who has been ordered to vacate premises fails to do so, application can be made to the Bailiff's Office to take appropriate steps to try to recover the debt or get back the premises for you (as the applicant). Bailiffs are authorised to:\n\n \n\n- seize goods and chattels of the debtor/defendant at a value equivalent to the judgment debts plus the incidental expenses of the execution; and\n- recover lands/premises.\n\nHowever, it is worth bearing the following points in mind:\n\n \n\n1. Judgments cannot always be enforced, for example, if the judgment debtor/defendant does not have any money or assets (or that person cannot be located).\n2. Bailiffs only execute court orders and judgments upon the instructions given by you (as the applicant). It is not the job of the Bailiff's Office to trace the location of the debtors or to ensure that the sum owed to you is recovered.\n3. There is no guarantee that the bailiffs will succeed in getting any sum or seizing any goods of value. In such cases, you still have to bear the costs of execution incurred by the bailiffs.\n4. You must be very careful in the instructions you give to the bailiffs. If goods and chattels are seized from the wrong persons or wrong locations, then any claim for wrongful seizure will be made against you and not the bailiffs. You should, if possible, accompany the bailiffs when they go to execute the writ. This enables you to give any further instructions on the spot.\n\n**Ways to execute a court order/judgment by the bailiffs**\n\n \n\nYou can apply for a writ of execution by the bailiffs depending on the nature of your case. The three major options are: (i) writ of fieri facias; (ii) warrant of distress and (iii) writ of possession.\n\n \n\n(i) Writ of fieri facias\n\n \n\nThis writ is useful when you cannot get the compensation/judgment debt from the defendant/debtor. If there are sufficient goods and chattels on the defendant/debtor's premises to justify a seizure, the bailiff will seize them up to the amount endorsed on the writ, plus the estimated costs of the execution. You have to give an undertaking to the bailiff to pay the necessary costs involved in effecting a seizure.\n\n \n\nIf the action is successful, the bailiff will take an inventory of all items seized. One copy will be passed to the security guard responsible for keeping watch over the items to ensure that they will not be tampered with or removed unlawfully.\n\n \n\nThe defendant has a period of 5 working days (following the date of seizure) to settle the debt plus the estimated costs incurred for the execution. If the defendant does not pay the total amount due, then the seized items will be sold on the first working day after this period by public auction. The proceeds at auction will then be used to settle the money due to you after defraying the necessary execution charges. (Note: If you think the seized goods may not be sold at the best price via public auction, you can apply to the court for permission to sell the goods in another way.)\n\n \n\n(ii) Warrant of distress\n\n \n\nDistress means the seizure and sale of chattels/goods found in a rented property to satisfy the **arrears of rent** . It is mostly used in cases in which a tenant is still operating a business at the rented property. This warrant may be obtained by a winning party who has filed a distraint case in the District Court. The procedure of execution is similar to that for the writ of fieri facias.\n\n \n\nIf the bailiff cannot enter the target premises, you can apply for a break open order to break into the premises after the bailiff has made two unsuccessful attempts to enter at different times.\n\n \n\n(iii) Writ of possession\n\n \n\nIt is commonly used for regaining possession of premises where the debtor fails to pay rent or make mortgage repayment to the landlord/mortgagee. It can also be used for taking over premises which are subject to a [charging order](http://www.clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/enforce_judgment/q5) while the property owner (i.e. the debtor) fails to repay.\n\n \n\nIf the bailiff cannot enter the target premises, there is no need for you to further apply for a break open order. A locksmith will be in attendance (when the bailiff goes to that premises for the third time) in order to break into the premises.\n\n \n\n**Costs for the bailiffs**\n\n \n\nYou have to pay:\n\n \n\n- a filing fee for the writ of execution;\n- a deposit for the bailiff's travelling expenses ($400 for the Hong Kong and Kowloon areas or $800 for the New Territories); and\n- a deposit for the cost of a maximum of 8 days' services by the security guard (note).\n\n(Note: The Bailiff's Office can arrange a private security guard service on your behalf. The security guard will accompany the Bailiff to carry out the execution and safeguard the goods and chattels seized after a successful execution. You should check with the Bailiff's Office about the approximate daily cost for this arrangement.)\n\n \n\nRegardless of whether or not the execution is successful, the bailiff's expenses and the security guard service fees are deducted from these deposits for each attempt at execution. The costs you incur may only be recovered if the execution is successful and the payment of the defendant or the proceeds of the sale of goods and chattels are enough to cover the judgment debt plus the costs incurred.\n\n \n\n**Further information**\n\n \n\nFor more details on the application procedure and other information about the Bailiff's Office, please visit the [Judiciary's website](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/bailiff.html).",

        "answer": "In such a case, garnishee proceedings may be considered.\n\n \n\nGarnishee proceedings provide the simplest method of enforcement where the judgment debtor is himself the creditor of a third party. Through garnishee proceedings, the obligation of the third party to pay money to the judgment debtor is transformed into an obligation of the third party to pay the money directly to you (as the judgment creditor).\n\n \n\nGarnishee proceedings is most commonly used to attach or freeze the sums of money which belong to the judgment debtor located in his bank account.\n\n \n\nWhere (i) you have obtained a judgment or order for the payment by the judgment debtor of a sum of money amounting in value to **at least $1,000** , and (ii) any other person (i.e. the third party who is considered as \"the garnishee\") within Hong Kong is indebted to that judgment debtor, the court may order the garnishee to pay you the amount of any debt due or accruing due to the judgment debtor from the garnishee (or so much of it as is sufficient to satisfy that judgment or order), and the costs of the garnishee proceedings.\n\n \n\nAn application for a garnishing order must be made ex parte (without notifying the debtor) supported by an [affidavit or affirmation](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial/q2):\n\n \n\n- stating the name and the last known address of the judgment debtor;\n- identifying the judgment or order to be enforced and stating the amount remaining unpaid under it at the time of the application for the garnishee order;\n- stating that, to the best of your information or belief, the garnishee, (i.e. the person who owes a sum of money to the judgment debtor) who must also be named, is within Hong Kong and is indebted to the judgment debtor, and stating the sources of your information or the grounds for your belief; and\n- stating, where the garnishee is a bank having more than one place of business, the name and address of the branch at which the judgment debtor's account is believed to be held or, if it be the case, that this information (about the debtor's account) is not known to you.\n\nA garnishee order must at first be an order nisi. That is, an order directed to the garnishee instructing him to show cause (to give any reasons to object the application) why the debt claimed to be due or accruing from him to the judgment debtor should not be utilized to satisfy the judgment debt and the costs of the garnishee proceedings.\n\n \n\nThe order nisi specifies the time and place for further consideration of the matter, and in the meantime attaches the debt claimed to be due or accruing from the garnishee to the judgment debtor, or so much of it as may be specified in the order. (See [Form No 72 in Appendix A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/appA.html) of the [Rules of the High Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) or [Form No 72 in Appendix A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/appA.html) of the [Rules of the District Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/) as appropriate.)\n\n \n\nUnless the court otherwise directs, the garnishee order nisi must be served (delivered):\n\n \n\n- on the garnishee by hand, at least 15 days before the day appointed thereby for the further consideration of the matter; and\n- on the judgment debtor, at least 7 days after the order has been served on the garnishee and at least 7 days before the day appointed for the further consideration of the matter.\n\nAs from the service of the garnishee order nisi on the garnishee, the order binds in his hands any debt specified in the order or so much of it as may be so specified.\n\n \n\nWhere, on the further consideration of the matter, the garnishee does not attend the court hearing or does not dispute the debt due or claimed to be due from him to the judgment debtor, the court may make a garnishing order absolute (finalized order) against the garnishee. (See [Form Nos. 73 and 74 in Appendix A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/appA.html) of the [Rules of the High Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) or [Form Nos. 73 and 74 in Appendix A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/appA.html) of the [Rules of the District Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/) as appropriate.) Upon granting of the garnishee order absolute, the garnishee should pay the amount specified in the garnishee order to the judgment creditor. The garnishee order absolute may be enforced in the same manner as any other order for the payment of money.\n\n \n\nWhere, on further consideration of the matter, the garnishee disputes liability to pay the debt due or claimed to be due from him to the judgment debtor, the court may have to examine the questions at issue in order to determine the liability of the garnishee.\n\n \n\nIf the garnishee has paid you the amount specified in the relevant garnishee order, he will be deemed to have settled his debt to the judgment debtor.",

        "question": "IF THE JUDGMENT DEBTOR DOES NOT HAVE ANY CASH BUT OWNS A PROPERTY/FLAT, CAN I (AS THE JUDGMENT CREDITOR) TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE DEBTOR'S FLAT?",
        "answer": "In such a case, a charging order may be considered.\n\n \n\nFor the purpose of enforcing the judgment in your favour, the court may make an order imposing on any such property of the judgment debtor as may be specified in the order, a charge for securing the payment of any money due or to become due under that judgment. Such an order is known as a \"charging order\". The effect of a charging order is similar to the creation of a mortgage on the debtor's flat, and your position is thus similar to a \"mortgagee\".\n\n \n\nThe types of property that a charging order can be imposed on include land/real estate, securities, or funds in court ([section 20A(2)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/4/s20a.html) of the [High Court Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/4/)).\n\n \n\nAs a judgment creditor, you should note that a charging order is an indirect mode of enforcement as it provides you with security only. If the judgment debtor fails to pay you pursuant to the charging order, you have to take further action to apply for an order to take over the subject property and sell it before you can recover the fruits of your judgment. If the relevant property is a flat (and it is already mortgaged to a bank), the charging order would be treated more or less the same as a second mortgage.\n\n \n\nThe judgment creditor's application for a charging order in respect of the judgment debtor’s beneficial interest may be made ex parte (without notifying the debtor). The application must be supported by an [affidavit or affirmation](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial/q2):\n\n \n\n- identifying the judgment or order to be enforced and stating the amount unpaid at the date of the application;\n- stating the name of the judgment debtor and of any creditor of his whom you (as the applicant) can identify;\n- giving full particulars of the subject-matter of the intended charge; and\n- verifying that the interest to be charged is owned beneficially by the judgment debtor (i.e. the debtor has contributed whole or part of the purchase price of the flat).\n\nUnless the court otherwise directs, the supporting affidavit or affirmation may contain statements of information or belief together with the sources and grounds for such information/belief.\n\n \n\nAny order made on such an application must at first be an order nisi. That is, an order directing the debtor to show cause (to give any reasons for objecting to the application). The order specifies the time and place for further consideration of the matter, and imposing the charge in any event until that time. The order nisi must be made on [Form No 75 in Appendix A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/appA.html) of the [Rules of the High Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) or [Form No 75 in Appendix A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/appA.html) of the [Rules of the District Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/) as appropriate.\n\n \n\nOn the making of the order nisi, notice of the order must, unless the court otherwise directs, be served as follows:\n\n \n\n- a copy of the order, together with a copy of the affidavit or affirmation in support, must be served on the judgment debtor;\n- where the order relates to securities other than securities in court, copies of the order must also be served:\n  1. in the case of stock of any company incorporated within Hong Kong (usually a limited company), on that company;\n  2. in the case of stock of any company incorporated outside Hong Kong, being stock registered in a register kept in Hong Kong, on the keeper of the register; and\n  3. in the case of units of any unit trust in respect of which a register of unit holders is kept in Hong Kong, on the keeper of the register.\n- where the order relates to a fund in court, a copy of the order must be served on the Registrar at the Registry; and\n- where the order relates to an interest under a trust, copies of the order must be served on such of the trustees as the court may direct.\n\n(NB (i) The court may also direct the service of copies of the order nisi, and of the affidavit or affirmation in support, on any other creditor of the judgment debtor or on any other interested person as may be appropriate in the circumstances. (ii) Documents to be served must be served at least seven days before the time appointed for the further consideration of the matter.)\n\n \n\nOn the further consideration of the matter, the court must either make the charging order absolute (finalized order), with or without modifications, or discharge it. In deciding whether to make the order, the court must consider all the circumstances of the case and, in particular, any evidence before it as to:\n\n \n\n- the personal circumstances of the judgment debtor; and\n- whether any other creditor of the judgment debtor would be likely to be unduly prejudiced by the making of the order.\n\n(NB Where the order is made absolute (finalized), it must be made using [Form No 76 in Appendix A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/appA.html) of the [Rules of the High Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) or [Form No 76 in Appendix A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/appA.html) of the [Rules of the District Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/) as appropriate.)\n\n \n\nOn the application of the judgment debtor or of any person interested in any property to which a charging order relates, the court may make an order discharging or varying the charging order.",

        "answer": "If you do not have a lawyer to represent you, you must meet with your witnesses and have a discussion with them before attending the trial. The purpose of that meeting is to assess their credibility, see what they know about your case and what they will probably say at the trial.\n\n \n\nHowever, you must NOT make up the answers for them.\n\n \n\nBad inference would be drawn by the court if your witnesses are just reading out your \"scripts\" during the trial. If it is proved that a witness has wilfully given false evidence, that person would be liable to a fine and imprisonment.\n\n \n\nYou may briefly tell your witnesses what you are going to ask during the trial, and tell them about the possibility of being questioned by your opponent and the judge. This could help reduce your witnesses' anxiety and encourage them to make preparations before entering the courtroom.\n\n \n\nYou should also remind your witnesses not to turn to you for looks of approval when answering questions from your opponent or the judge.\n\n \n\nThe attendance of your witnesses must be secured well in advance (preferably three weeks prior to the trial date). If you are not sure whether they will attend the trial, you may try to secure their attendance by issuing a writ of subpoena (i.e. a witness summons compelling the target witness to attend the trial, see Form No 28 or 29 in [Appendix A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/appA.html) of the [Rules of the High Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) ([Cap. 4A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/)) or Form No 28 or 29 in [Appendix A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/appA.html) of the [Rules of the District Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/) ([Cap. 336H](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/)) as appropriate).\n\n \n\nThe appropriate office for issuing such a writ is [the Registry ](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/about_us/business_hours.html)of the relevant court. Every writ of subpoena should be accompanied by a deposit that will be used to cover the witness's reasonable expenses.",

        "question": "HOW TO PREPARE AN AFFIDAVIT OR AFFIRMATION?",
        "answer": "An affidavit or affirmation is a statement of facts made by a person under oath. Generally, this is the means by which the parties or their witnesses submit evidence to the court during the hearing of an interlocutory application (or other kinds of application).\n\n \n\nA Catholic or a Christian should make **affidavits**. People of other religious beliefs or no religious belief should make **affirmations**. The form used for an affidavit or affirmation is obtainable from the Registries of the High Court and the District Court and the Resource Centre for Unrepresented Litigants (see the last paragraph).\n\n \n\nThe person who gives written evidence in an affidavit or affirmation is called a **deponent.** A deponent should only give facts as evidence in his affidavit or affirmation (unless he is an expert witness, who can also give opinion within his expertise as evidence). The evidence given must be within the deponent's personal knowledge. (However, the affidavit or affirmation may contain statements of information or belief if the sources of the information and the grounds of the belief are stated.) It should be noted that a deponent is personally liable for the truthfulness or accuracy of the contents of his affidavit or affirmation. He commits perjury if he knowingly gives false or misleading evidence in his affidavit or affirmation.\n\n \n\nThe contents of an affidavit or affirmation should be set out in short, numbered paragraphs. The sentences in the paragraphs should be clear and concise. The documents referred to in the affidavit or affirmation should be marked as exhibits (similar to attachments) annexed (attached) to the affidavit or affirmation. The exhibits should be numbered for easy identification.\n\n \n\nIt is desirable to have a typewritten affidavit or affirmation. If it is hand-written, the deponent should write the words clearly on alternate lines. If an affidavit or affirmation is not legible, the court may order the deponent to put it in a proper form and manner (re do it, so that it is clear and legible). The hearing of the relevant interlocutory or other kinds of application may have to be adjourned for that purpose. (In such a case, the deponent, as the party who causes the adjournment, may be ordered to bear the costs for the time wasted.)\n\n \n\nAfter finalizing the contents of your affidavit/affirmation, your lawyer will arrange for you to swear and sign this document in front of another lawyer who is not involved in your case. Alternatively, you can swear and sign your affidavit/affirmation at the Oaths and Declarations Office of the High Court.\n\n \n\nMore explanatory notes for preparing an affidavit or affirmation and a sample affidavit / affirmation can be obtained from the [Resource Centre for Unrepresented Litigants](http://rcul.judiciary.hk/rc/eng/siteMap.jsp). Reference should also be made to [Practice Direction 10.1 (Affidavit Evidence)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/other/pd/PD10.1.html).",

        "question": "IF THE DEFENDANT FILED A DEFENCE, BUT IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY REASONABLE POINTS, CAN THE PLAINTIFF APPLY FOR A \"FAST JUDGMENT\" WITHOUT GOING THROUGH A TRIAL?",
        "answer": "In such a case, the plaintiff can apply for a **summary judgment** against the defendant, on the grounds that the defendant has no defence to the claim. In this context, \"no defence\" generally means the defence pleaded by the defendant is not supported with any reasonable grounds, concrete evidence or arguable points.\n\n \n\nThe procedure for summary judgment enables the plaintiff to obtain judgment without the delay and expense of a full trial. In other words, the judgment is granted by the court without hearing the oral evidence/arguments from both parties and their witnesses in a trial. However, an application for summary judgment should not be made when the case involves serious important factual disputes. This is because, to defeat a summary judgment application, the defendant does not have to show he has a good defence but only that he has an arguable defence. If the defendant's assertions are believable, he will have leave (permission) to defend. The court will also permit the defendant to defend if the judge thinks that there should be a trial for some other reasons (e.g. the defendant is unable to get in touch with an important witness who might be able to provide him with material for a defence). For further information about the summary judgment procedure, please refer to [Order 14](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/s14.html) of the [Rules of the High Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) or [Order 14](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/s14.html) of the [Rules of the District Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H) as appropriate.",

        "question": "THE TRIAL HAS NOT YET COMMENCED BUT THE DEFENDANT'S WRONGDOING HAS ALREADY CAUSED SOME DAMAGE TO THE PLAINTIFF. WHAT CAN THE PLAINTIFF DO TO STOP THE DEFENDANT'S WRONGDOING IN THE MEANTIME?",
        "answer": "**Permanent injunction**\n\n \n\nSometimes, the plaintiff will seek a court order at the trial either compelling the defendant to take specified steps (known as a \"mandatory injunction\") or restraining him from taking specified steps (known as a \"prohibitory injunction\"). These two types of injunction orders, if granted by the court, may permanently bind the wrongdoer/defendant. However, the case may take several years to reach court for a final settlement. By the time it comes to trial, the defendant's alleged wrongdoing may have already caused damage to the plaintiff. In such a case, the plaintiff may consider applying for an interlocutory injunction (see below).\n\n \n\n(Note: Application for the above permanent injunction orders must be made by way of [writ of summons](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/start_civil_action/q9). Due to the complexity of the application procedures, you should seek legal advice before making such an application.)\n\n \n\n**Interlocutory injunction (a temporary court order)**\n\n \n\nWith a view to avoiding the potential injustice of such situations, the court has the power to make a provisional order before trial to regulate the position between the parties pending the trial. This order is called an \"interlocutory injunction\", and is usually a temporary version of the type of injunction the plaintiff will seek at the trial.\n\n \n\nAn application for the grant of an interlocutory injunction must be made by motion or summons. The application must be supported by an [affirmation or affidavit](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial/q2) setting out the facts giving rise to the cause of legal action against the defendant, the facts giving rise to the claim for injunctive relief, and the relief sought.\n\n \n\nHowever, if the case is urgent, such application may be made ex parte (i.e. without giving notice to the defendant) supported by an affidavit or affirmation. If the application is made ex parte, the plaintiff must disclose to the court all facts which are important to the proceedings. It is advisable to read the Judiciary's [Practice Direction 11.1 (Ex Parte, Interim and Interlocutory Applications for Injunctions)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/other/pd/PD11.1.html) carefully for details of the application procedure to be followed.\n\n \n\nGenerally, the court will grant an interlocutory injunction if the plaintiff can show that:\n\n \n\n- there is a serious question to be tried (i.e. the claim must not be frivolous or vexatious and must have prospect of success); and\n- the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the injunction.\n\nIn determining where the **balance of convenience** lies, the court will take all relevant circumstances of the case into account (e.g. the importance of the preservation of the existing situation, the relative strength of the parties' respective cases, etc). In particular, it will ask whether damages (monetary compensation) are an adequate remedy for the plaintiff and whether the defendant is able to pay the compensation.\n\n \n\nIf \"yes\", the injunction will be refused.\n\n \n\nIf \"no\", the court will next consider whether the giving of an undertaking as to damages by the plaintiff is adequate protection for the defendant and whether the plaintiff is able to honour such an undertaking. If the answer is \"yes\", the court will grant an interlocutory injunction.\n\n \n\n(Note: The undertaking as to damages is the plaintiff’s promise to pay the defendant compensation if the plaintiff later fails to prove that he is entitled to such an injunction order.)\n\n \n\nA defendant in such a case must note that wilful failure to comply with the terms of an injunction order may lead to a sentence of imprisonment.",

        "question": "WHAT CAN THE PLAINTIFF DO IF THE DEFENDANT IS LIKELY TO DISPOSE OF HIS ASSETS IMPROPERLY BEFORE THE CASE PROCEEDS TO TRIAL?",
        "answer": "In such case, the plaintiff may consider applying for a Mareva injunction.\n\n \n\nA Mareva injunction is a form of interlocutory injunction which is a court order made before trial to keep matters in their original state until the trial can be heard. It has the effect of restraining the defendant from disposing of, or dissipating, his assets before the court delivers the judgment at trial.\n\n \n\nIn a very exceptional case, the court may even grant a world-wide Mareva injunction that affects the defendant's assets abroad.\n\n \n\nBreach of a Mareva injunction by the defendant may lead to imprisonment.\n\n \n\nThe initial application for a Mareva injunction is usually made ex parte (i.e. without giving notice to the defendant). This is because knowledge by the defendant that the application is processing may well defeat the original purpose which the plaintiff is trying to achieve. The application procedure to be followed has been prescribed in [Practice Direction 11.1 (Ex Parte, Interim and Interlocutory Applications for Injunctions)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/other/pd/PD11.1.html) and must be carefully studied. It is important to note that:\n\n \n\n- the plaintiff, as the applicant for an ex parte Mareva injunction, must ensure that he makes full and frank disclosure of all the important matters within his knowledge; and\n- if the Mareva injunction is granted, the plaintiff will normally be required to give some undertakings, one of which being an undertaking in damages/compensation (i.e. a promise to pay the defendant compensation for any loss incurred as a result of the injunction if the plaintiff later fails to prove that he is entitled to such an injunction order). Sometimes the plaintiff may also have to pay reasonable costs to any third parties (e.g. banks) who have to check whether they hold any assets related to the case. Therefore, **it is not rational for the plaintiff to make such an application if the amount or value of the assets under dispute is small** .\n\nThe court will grant a Mareva injunction if the plaintiff can show that:\n\n \n\n- there is a good arguable case on a substantive claim against the defendant;\n- the defendant has assets within Hong Kong;\n- the [balance of convenience](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial/q6) is in favour of granting this injunction order; and\n- there is a real risk of dissipation or secretion of assets by the defendant before the court can make the final judgment at the coming trial.\n\n(Note: The requirements for the grant of a Mareva injunction have been effectively summarized in [Practice Direction 11.2 (Mareva Injunctions and Anton Piller Orders)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/other/pd/PD11.2.html). The Practice Direction also provides the standard form for use on an application for a Mareva injunction. It is therefore vital to pay close attention to the Practice Direction and legal advice must be sought if you have further queries.)\n\n \n\nA Mareva injunction granted ex parte will subsequently be heard at an inter-partes hearing (i.e. a hearing involving all parties, after notice has been given to the defendant) on a \"return date\". At the hearing, the defendant may apply to have the injunction set aside (for example, on the ground that the injunction was obtained as a result of important non-disclosure of information by the plaintiff). If the Mareva injunction is granted, the defendant could still withdraw a certain sum of money for daily living expenses and for carrying on his existing business (if any).",

        "question": "WHAT CAN THE PLAINTIFF DO IF HE WANTS TO ENTER THE DEFENDANT’S PREMISES TO SEARCH FOR AND SEIZE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS OR PROPERTY BEFORE THE CASE PROCEEDS TO TRIAL?",
        "answer": "In such a case, the plaintiff may consider applying for an Anton Piller Order.\n\n \n\nAn Anton Piller Order compels the defendant to permit the plaintiff's representatives to enter his premises, search for and (in most cases) seize documents or other things which are relevant to the case. This order is especially useful in cases involving infringement of [intellectual property rights](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/intellectualProperty/) and [matrimonial proceedings](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/familyMatrimonialAndCohabitation/divorce/proceduresAndGroundsForDivorce/) where it is believed that a spouse has not truly disclosed his or her assets.\n\n \n\nThe procedure for obtaining an Anton Piller order follows broadly the equivalent procedure for obtaining a Mareva injunction (see [question 7 above](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial/q7)).\n\n \n\nIn order to prevent the defendant from concealing, destroying or disposing of the documents or articles in question, the application for an Anton Piller Order is invariably made ex parte (without giving notice to the defendant). The court will therefore require full and frank disclosure by the plaintiff. Otherwise, any order granted may be discharged.\n\n \n\nThe plaintiff also has to give, among other things, the undertaking as to damages/compensation (to compensate the defendant for any loss that has been caused by the carrying out of such an order).\n\n \n\nSince an Anton Piller order involves the violation of the defendant's (residential and business) premises, it is regarded as a draconian measure. Whether to grant the order is a matter for the discretion of the judge hearing the application. In order to secure the grant of the order, the plaintiff has to satisfy the judge that:\n\n \n\n- there must be a strong prima facie case of a civil cause of action (i.e. the claim/allegation against the defendant is likely to be justified);\n- the danger to the plaintiff to be avoided by the grant of an order must be serious;\n- the risk of destruction or removal of evidence by the defendant must be a good deal more than merely possible; and\n- the harm likely to be caused by the execution of the order to the defendant and his business affairs must not be excessive or out of proportion to the legitimate object of the order.\n\n\n(Remarks: (i) In the affidavit or affirmation in support of the application, the plaintiff should therefore clearly describe the defendant's premises and the relevant documents or property and show strong evidence that serious harm or injustice will be suffered if the order is not made. (ii) The standard form and contents of an Anon Piller order to allow entry and search of premises have been prescribed by the Judiciary's [Practice Direction 11.2 (Mareva Injunctions and Anton Piller Orders)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/other/pd/PD11.2.html). The Practice Direction should be read carefully and legal advice must be sought if you have further queries.)\n\n \n\nAt the time of application for the ex parte Anton Piller order, the plaintiff should also apply for a date to be fixed for an inter-partes hearing (i.e. a hearing involving all parties, after giving notice to the defendant). At this hearing, the defendant is at liberty to apply to set aside the order and to get back all the seized documents.\n\n \n\nIt is important to note that an Anton Piller order does not amount to a search warrant and therefore no forcible entry to the defendant's premises can be made. In other words, the plaintiff cannot break open the door and enter the premises if the defendant refuses entry. However, a defendant who fails to comply with the order can be committed for contempt of court and may be liable to imprisonment.",

This is an advance payment (made before the final conclusion of the case) that will be taken from any compensation, debt or other sum (excluding legal costs) which a defendant may eventually be held liable to pay.\n\n \n\nThere are often occasions when it is clear that the plaintiff has a strong case against the defendant with respect to liability and will recover damages at the end.

The system of interim payments is devised to prevent the plaintiff from being kept out of his money for an inappropriately long period.\n\n \n\nThere are three grounds for the plaintiff to apply for an interim payment:\n\n \n\n- the defendant has already admitted liability;\n- the plaintiff has obtained judgment against the defendant but the amount of compensation is yet to be assessed by the court; or\n- if the action proceeded to trial, the plaintiff would obtain judgment for substantial compensation against the defendant.\n\n(Note: The grounds for applying for an interim payment in respect of sums other than damages are different. For details, please refer to [Order 29, r 12](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/s29.html) of the [Rules of the High Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) or [Order 29, r 12](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/s29.html) of the [Rules of the District Court](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/) as appropriate.)\n\n \n\nThe plaintiff may make an application for interim payment by summons at any time after the writ has been served on the defendant and the time limit for him to acknowledge service has expired. The application must be supported by the plaintiff's [affirmation or affidavit](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial/q2):\n\n \n\n- verifying the amount of the damages, debt or other sums to which the application relates, and the grounds of the application; and\n- attaching any documentary evidence relied upon by the plaintiff in support of the application.\n\nIf the application is successful, the court may make an order for an interim payment of such amount as it thinks just. An interim payment may be ordered to be made in one lump sum or in specified instalments. The payment is normally ordered to be made directly to the plaintiff.\n\n \n\n**Provisional damages for personal injuries**\n\n \n\nAn interim payment should be differentiated from an award of provisional damages for personal injuries.\n\n \n\nGenerally, an award of damages in a personal injuries case is a once-and-for-all payment. However, this is not ideal for the plaintiff, as there are cases where there is a chance that the injury will get worse at some future date. To remedy the situation, the courts are given the power to make awards of provisional damages.\n\n \n\nProvisional damages are appropriate in personal injuries cases where there is proved or admitted to be a chance that at some definite or indefinite time in the future, the plaintiff will develop some serious disease or suffer some serious deterioration in his physical or mental condition. In such cases, the court can award damages (known as provisional damages) on the assumption that the plaintiff will not develop the disease or suffer the deterioration. If the plaintiff does develop the disease or suffer the deterioration, he can go back to the court for further damages at a future date.\n\n \n\nThe plaintiff has to note that, in order to claim for provisional damages, it must be pleaded in his statement of claim. Where an application is made for an award of provisional damages, the defendant may at any time make a written offer to pay a sum in satisfaction of the plaintiff's claim for his present injuries and agreeing to the making of an award for provisional damages. The plaintiff is given 21 days to accept. If the offer is accepted, the plaintiff applies to the court by summons for the appropriate order.\n\n \n\nFor more information concerning personal injuries litigation, please go to another topic – [Personal Injuries](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/personalInjuries).",

        "question": "IF THE DEFENDANT WINS THE CASE, HIS LEGAL COSTS MAY BE RECOVERED FROM THE PLAINTIFF. WHAT CAN THE DEFENDANT DO IF HE IS WORRIED THAT, IN THE EVENT OF DEFEATING THE PLAINTIFF'S CLAIM, THE PLAINTIFF WOULD BE UNABLE TO MEET ANY ORDER FOR LEGAL COSTS MADE AT THE TRIAL?",
        "answer": "In such a case, the defendant may consider making an application for the plaintiff to provide security for costs.\n\n \n\nIf the application is granted, the plaintiff will be required to pay a specified sum of money into court (similar to a deposit) within a specified period. Normally, the proceedings will be temporarily halted until the plaintiff complies with the order for the payment of security for costs. In the event of the defendant being successful in defeating the plaintiff's claim, the money paid by the plaintiff can be used to settle the defendant's legal costs.\n\n \n\nThe defendant can rely on any of the following grounds to make the application:\n\n \n\n- the plaintiff is ordinarily resident out of Hong Kong;\n- the plaintiff, not being a plaintiff who is suing in a representative capacity, is a nominal plaintiff who is suing for the benefit of some other person and there is reason to believe that he will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if ordered to do so;\n- the plaintiff's address is not stated in the writ or other court documents or is incorrectly stated there (unless the court is satisfied that the failure to state the address or the misstatement was made innocently and without intention to deceive);\n- the plaintiff has changed his address during the course of the proceedings with a view to evading the consequences of the litigation; or\n- if the plaintiff is a limited company registered in Hong Kong or a company incorporated outside Hong Kong, the defendant can use [section 905](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/622/s905.html) of the [Companies Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/622/) ([Cap. 622](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/622/) of the Laws of Hong Kong) – i.e. \"if it appears on credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the company will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in his defence\".\n\nThis application is made in chambers (not in open court) by means of a summons. Before making this application to the court, the defendant should send a written request to the plaintiff asking for the security payment. The defendant should prepare an [affidavit or affirmation](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial/q2) to support the application.\n\n \n\nHowever, no affidavit/affirmation is necessary if the grounds upon which the defendant relies is the fact that the plaintiff is ordinarily resident out of Hong Kong and that fact is stated on the writ. The summons or affidavit/affirmation should indicate the amount of security required, and a skeleton bill of costs (a detailed list of all the relevant items) should be prepared to show how that amount is made up.\n\n \n\nAlthough this application may be made at any stage of the proceedings, it should not be made too late or too close to the trial. This is because any delay may count against the defendant when the court considers the application.",

        "question": "WHAT SHOULD BE NOTED ABOUT EXPERT WITNESSES? SHOULD I CALL THEM TO GIVE EVIDENCE FOR MY CASE?",
        "answer": "Sometimes, a case may involve technical matters which are likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of the parties and the judge. Examples include: a doctor to explain a medical report, a surveyor to advise on the value of a property, an engineer to explain a mechanical & engineering problem, a psychologist to explain the mental behaviour of a victim, etc. The parties and the judge may therefore find it beneficial to have some experts in the particular field of knowledge involved to help them understand the relevant issues. The major shortfalls on calling expert witnesses are the extra costs and time incurred.\n\n \n\nIf the parties want to call expert witnesses to give evidence at the trial, they have to apply for leave (permission) from the court. The court may grant leave to the parties with appropriate directions (e.g. the number of expert witnesses from each side, the time allowed for the parties to file and exchange their expert reports, etc). A party who fails to comply with these directions may be disallowed to give expert evidence at the trial. Alternatively, the court may order that judgment be entered against a defaulting party who deliberately refuses to comply with the directions of the court without a valid reason. If the court makes that judgment, the defaulting party will have lost the whole case.",

        "question": "WHAT ARE THE OTHER GENERAL MATTERS THAT I SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO CONCERNING THE CONDUCT OF CIVIL ACTIONS IN COURT?",
        "answer": "A litigant in person is required to comply with the rules or the procedures for court proceedings, on the principle that all parties are equal before the court.\n\n \n\n**Language**\n\n \n\nThe parties are entitled to use Chinese or English in their [pleadings](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary) or other court documents. If one of the parties requires the other party to use English or Chinese in the pleadings or other court documents, an application may be made to the court. The court will take all relevant factors into consideration and make the order. The court may order that all the proceedings be in Chinese or in English. Alternatively, the court may order a party to provide translation of the documents for the other party. The court may order the requesting party to pay the costs for the translation of the documents. Such costs may be ordered to be paid at the end of the trial or forthwith.\n\n \n\n**Document exchange with the other party**\n\n \n\nYou should also remember that when you file a document with the court, you have to send a copy of that document to the other party or parties as well in order to give them notice. For the same reason, you should check your mail-box to see if the other party or parties are sending you court documents. This is your own duty. You have no excuse for not doing this and then trying to tell the court at the hearing that you had no notice of the court documents.\n\n \n\n**Court attendance**\n\n \n\nYou will only be required to attend court upon notice or by summons (i.e. application by a party to the civil action). You may make inquiries at [the relevant Court Registry ](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/about_us/business_hours.html)(depending on which court or tribunal handles your case). You must be punctual in attending court.\n\n \n\n**During the hearing or trial**\n\n \n\nAt a hearing or the trial, you should act according to the direction of the judge or [master](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary). The parties will take turns to make speeches. You may make notes of anything you disagree with and put forward your arguments when your turn comes to speak. You may refer to the relevant case law, legislation or other materials in support of your arguments. It is important that you behave properly in court. You must not use abusive language or remarks. Although the atmosphere during an argument will sometimes become heated or even emotional, you should bear in mind that the best way to put forward your argument is to speak in a calm, cool and polite manner. Therefore, you should control your temper in court.\n\n \n\n**After the hearing or trial**\n\n \n\nAfter a hearing or the trial, if the judge or master gives a decision and the reasons orally, you should not intervene even if you do not agree with the judge or master. It is no use to argue with the judge or master. If you are dissatisfied with the decision of the master or the judge, you have the right to appeal against that decision (unless it is from the Court of Final Appeal).\n\n \n\n**Contact with the judge**\n\n \n\nYou should never directly contact the judge or [master](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary#c) by any means in the course of a civil action. You should address your letters to the clerk of the relevant judge or master. You should also send a copy of any such letters to the other party as well. You should not send letters to the judge or master to state the merits of your case. Your case should be clearly set out in the documents which you file in court to support your case.",

Therefore, upon receipt of a writ of summons, you should first consider whether you should defend the claim.\n\n \n\nApart from considering whether you have a legal basis to defend the claim brought against you, you should also consider the matters set out in the section [\"Matters to be considered before starting a civil action\"](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/before_civil_action). In particular, you should be aware that if you defend the case and end up losing the case, you will normally be ordered to pay costs (this generally means legal costs) to the plaintiff. You are not exempt from this even if you are a litigant in person (defending yourself without appointing a lawyer). The costs are the expenses that the winning party has to spend on the preparation and hearing of the matter. These include the expenses for the lawyers representing the winning party (if any). The amount of the costs can be substantial, depending on the complexity of the case, the preparation work required and the length of the hearing.\n\n \n\nYou are recommended to obtain legal advice before deciding whether or not you should defend a claim brought against you.",

If the Plaintiff accepts the amount admitted by the Defendant, he can then file and serve a Form 16A (or Form 16D as the case may be) and request the Court to enter judgment on the amount you offered with costs. Conversely, if the Plaintiff does not accept the Defendant’s amount admitted, he will file and serve a Form 16B (or Form 16E as the case may be) to reject it, and in such circumstances the case maybe proceeded as if the Defendant contests the proceedings. Unless and until the Plaintiff filed the above prescribed forms in response to the Defendant’s admission, his claim will be stayed.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, the Defendant may consider making a “sanctioned payment”, i.e. a payment into court pursuant to Order 22 of [the Rules of the High Court](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) ([Cap. 4A](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/)) or [the Rules of the District Court](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/) ([Cap. 336H](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/)) as a settlement offer to the Plaintiff.\n\n \n\nThe advantage of “sanctioned payment” is that if the Defendant’s sanctioned payment is not accepted by the Plaintiff, and the Plaintiff fails to obtain a judgment better than the payment, the Plaintiff may have to pay the Defendant’s costs on an indemnity basis and enhanced interest (up to 10% above judgment rate) on those costs.

Some common ways are:\n\n \n\n1. serving the legal process on him or her personally. \n2. sending the legal process (enclosed in a sealed envelope) by registered post to the defendant at his/her usual or last known address.\n3. inserting the legal process through the letter box of the usual or last known address of the defendant.\n\n \n\nTherefore, if the plaintiff believes that the defendant will leave Hong Kong soon, it is advisable for him or her to commence proceedings immediately and serve the legal process on him or her as soon as possible in Hong Kong.\n\n \n\n(b) Yes. However, you will need to apply for leave from the Court if you want to serve the legal process out of the jurisdiction of Hong Kong on specified grounds set out in Order 11 of [the Rules of the High Court](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/) ([Cap. 4A](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/4A/)) or [the Rules of the District Court](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/) ([Cap. 336H](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/336H/)).\n\n \n\n(c) Yes. The court does not prohibit you from commencing a legal proceedings against a defendant even though the defendant is missing. \n\n \n\nHowever, as the plaintiff, you have the duty to serve the legal process and bring the legal proceedings to the defendant’s attention. If the defendant is missing and it is impracticable to serve documents on him or her in the manner prescribed by the court rules, you may consider applying to the court for substituted service of the legal process on the defendant (for example, effecting service by advertising the legal proceedings on newspaper). The plaintiff in such circumstances must satisfy the Court that (1) service on the defendant was attempted but in vain and that the Plaintiff has exhausted all reasonable means to serve on the defendant; and (2) the proposed mode(s) of substituted service can reasonably bring notice of the proceedings to the defendant.\n\n \n\n(d) Yes, instituting an action against an unnamed defendant who is identified by description is permissible where the circumstances so warrant. The crucial point is that the description of the defendant must be sufficiently certain so as to identify those who are included and those who are not.\n\n \n\nFor example, if the plaintiff’s land is trespassed and unlawfully occupied by some unknown trespasser(s) or occupier(s) and he would like to institute a legal proceedings for recovery of land, one possible description of the defendant in such situation could be “*All Occupier(s) the [full address of the land]*”.",

        "question": "HOW WILL THE COURT GIVE DIRECTIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF A CASE BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF A TRIAL?",
        "answer": "In order for the Court to manage and monitor the progress of a civil action and to ensure that all preparations before trial will be conducted in a proper manner (including discovery, exchange of witness statements and exchange of experts' reports (if any)), the following steps shall be taken by the parties after close of pleadings.\n## [SETTLEMENT](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/settlement)\n\n## VI. SETTLEMENT\n\n## [REMOTE HEARING](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/remote_hearing)\n\n## XII. REMOTE HEARING\n\nIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 which disrupted the court business, the Court has been gradually expanded the use of remote hearing (without requiring the physical presence of the litigants or their legal representatives in Court) to conduct court business by way of using the telephone or video-conferencing facilities (VCF).\n\n \n\n**A. Use of video conferencing facilities (VCF) for hearings**\n\n \n\nUse of VCF is one of the common ways to conduct remote hearing for court business.\n\n \n\nThe Court will consider which cases, for which hearings have been fixed for future dates, might be suitable for disposal (in whole or in part) by a remote hearing using VCF, and give appropriate directions to the parties in advance. It is a case management question within the discretion of the Court.\n\n \n\nSometimes, parties to the proceedings may make application to the Court for use of VCF. For example, a witness is residing overseas and unable to return to Hong Kong to give evidence in Court personally due to travel restrictions, and the party may want to apply to the Court to receive the witness’s evidence via VCF.\n\n \n\nIn making the case management decision as to whether the hearing shall be dealt with remotely, the court will take into account the views of the parties, the availability of VCF equipment, the subject-matter and nature of the proceedings and whether the proposed use of VCF is likely to promote the fair and efficient disposal of proceedings (including through the avoidance or reduction of delay) and/or to save costs.\n\n \n\n**B. Telephone hearings**\n\n \n\nUse of telephone is another way to conduct remote hearing for court business.\n\n \n\nAgain, the Court will take initiative to consider which case or hearing might be suitable for disposal by a remote hearing using telephone, and give appropriate directions in advance. In light of its nature, telephone hearings will usually be applicable to short directions hearings and 3-minute list.\n\n \n\n**C. Browser-based VCF hearings**\n\n \n\nFrom 2 January 2021, the court has launched a ‘browser-based’ VCF option. It is a low-cost option, since court users will only need a normal computer (not a mobile device) with a camera function to connect to the court for VCF hearings. This new option intends to encourage the use of VCF facilities by litigants-in-person.\n\n \n \n\n\\1. Within 28 days of the closing of pleadings, parties to the proceedings shall file and serve their respective Timetabling Questionnaire (“TQ”) to provide information about their cases, and propose case management directions for the Court’s consideration.\n\n \n\n\\2. Then the Plaintiff shall take out a *Case Management Summons* with the Court to fix a Case Management Summons Hearing (“CMS Hearing”) before the court so that the court can give the appropriate directions to the parties to prepare the case for trial, such as fixing the timetable for the parties to exchange list of documents, to exchange witness statement, and to prepare expert report (if appropriate) etc.\n\n \n\n\\3. In giving the case management directions as aforesaid, the Court will usually adjourn the CMS Hearing or fix a Case Management Conference (“CMC”).  In case of the adjourned CMS hearing, an updated TQ will need to be filed and served before the next hearing. For the CMC, a Listing Questionnaire together with a CMC Bundle will be required to be filed and served beforehand.\n\n ",

        "question": "WHAT IF I AM MISREPRESENTED (MISLED) BY OTHERS IN ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT. WILL THE LAW HELP ME TO DISCHARGE THE CONTRACT OR CLAIM COMPENSATION?",
        "answer": "A person who makes a false statement of fact that induces ( or persuades) another person to enter into a contract is guilty of making a misrepresentation. The three pre-requisites for misrepresentation are: (i) someone has given a statement of fact, (ii) that statement is wrong, and (iii) that false statement induced the innocent party to enter into the contract.\n\n \n\nNote that a \"statement of fact\" is different from a \"statement of opinion\". For example, a car seller would only have given a statement of opinion if he told you that a van might be able to carry 1,000 kg of goods and asked you to try it before confirming your order. However, he would have made a statement of fact if he told you that the van had a 2,500 cc engine. The seller would be liable for misrepresentation if you confirmed your order as a result of his statement, but subsequently discovered that the actual capacity of the van's engine was only 1,500 cc.\n\n \n\nThe [Misrepresentation Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/284/) ([Cap. 284](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/284/) of the Laws of Hong Kong) allows the innocent party to apply to court to rescind the contract (cancel the contract and restore the parties to where they were before the contract was made) and to claim compensation.",

        "answer": "When a person or company sells products through sales agents, that person or company (as the principal) is liable for any contracts that are entered into by its agents, and may be sued on these contracts.

        "question": "WHAT SHOULD I BE AWARE OF BEFORE MAKING A CONTRACT WITH OTHERS THROUGH THE INTERNET?",
        "answer": "According to [section 17](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/553/s17.html) of the [Electronic Transactions Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/553/) ([Cap. 553](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/553/) of the Laws of Hong Kong), contracts can be made by means of electronic records (such as e-mails) unless otherwise agreed by the contracting parties. In addition, electronic records that can be accessed for subsequent reference are allowed as evidence in court proceedings, except those that are set out in [schedule 1](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/553/sch1.html) to the [Electronic Transactions Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/553/) such as wills, power of attorney, contracts for sale of land or real estate and mortgages.\n\n \n\nIf the contract requires the signatures of the parties (but does not involve government organisations), then the parties can use any form of electronic signature that is reliable, appropriate and agreed by the recipient of the signature. For example, the parties may sign a hard copy, scan the document into a computer and then send it via e-mail. If the contract involves government or banking services, the parties must use \"digital signatures\", which are supported by a recognised certificate that is issued by the Postmaster General. For more information about digital signatures, please go to the [website](http://www.hongkongpost.gov.hk/product/ecert/usage/index.html) of the Hongkong Post.\n\n \n\nIf a contract is made between two persons or companies in different countries over the Internet, then that contract will be enforced by the law of the place with the closest connection to the contract (*** note**). In terms of taxation, the tax law of the place where the profits are made will apply (unless otherwise stated). For example, if you ship your goods to Japan and sell them there, then you will be liable for Japanese tax. However, this is only the basic rule. You should consult an expert in that field before proceeding with such business.\n\n \n\n(*** Note**: In determining which place has the closest connection to the contract, the common law generally takes the following factors into consideration: the place of contracting, the place where the contractual duties are performed, the places of residence or businesses of the parties, and the nature and subject matter of the contract. However, the courts stress that these factors are not exhaustive, and that any other factors which are relevant to the contract may also be considered. You should therefore seek legal advice if there is a query or dispute.)\n\n \n\nCare must also be taken when submitting personal information through the Internet. The Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) provides for specific controls over the use of the data by merchants and the rights of consumers to access their own data. You can obtain more information concerning this matter from the [Personal Data Privacy](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/personalDataPrivacy/) topic.## [ANSWER TO SCENARIO 1](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/businessAndCommerce/case_illustration/Scenarios_in_Hong_Kong/Scenario_1)\n\n## **SCENARIO 1**\n\nCompany A advertised a conference table for sale for $50,000 in a local daily newspaper. They received one telephone call in response to the advertisement, and the manager of Company A arranged to meet the caller, the representative of Company B, at the showroom of Company A. Having inspected the conference table, the representative of Company B said that Company B would buy it but that they would need time to arrange the payment. Before leaving the showroom, the manager of Company A and the representative shook hands and exchanged business cards. Three days later, the representative of Company B telephoned the manager of Company A to say that he would deliver the cash to Company A the next day. The manager of Company A said nothing in response. Can the manager of Company A refuse to sell the conference table to Company B when the representative of Company B arrives at the showroom of Company A with the $50,000?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n**Answer**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIn contract law, an advertisement is only an invitation to treat (an invitation requesting the other party to make an offer, see the [relevant question and answer](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/businessAndCommerce/setting_up_business_in_Hong_Kong/making_a_business_contract/q1)) unless there is other evidence to the contrary. Therefore, the advertisement of Company A was not an offer, and no contract can be invoked at this stage.\n\n \n\nThe gesture of Company B's representative that was made at the showroom probably did not constitute an offer to buy the table, as there was still some doubt as to when or whether payment could be arranged. The second telephone call from the representative of Company B constituted an offer, but the silence of the manager of Company A cannot be construed as an acceptance of that offer. As Company A has not made a valid acceptance, no contract has been created. The manager of Company A can thus refuse to sell the conference table to Company B.\n\n## [ANSWER TO SCENARIO 2](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/businessAndCommerce/case_illustration/Scenarios_in_Hong_Kong/Scenario_2)\n\n## **SCENARIO 2**\n\nThe manager of Company A, a printing company, ordered a new colour printing machine from Company B to be delivered on 1 November. The machine was not delivered on time, but because there is a low demand for printing services between November and February, the manager of Company A did not contact Company B about the matter until 20 February of the next year, when he sent a fax to Company B enquiring about delivery of the machine. He was told by return fax that the machine would be delivered the following week. However, the machine was not delivered for another three months. Since the time when the manager of Company A enquired about the delivery of the machine, Company A has only been able to fulfil 50% of the printing jobs that it could have handled had they had the machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan Company A purchase the printing machine from another manufacturer and sue Company B for damages (compensation)? Would the basis for the calculation of the damages be different if Company A had also lost a profitable printing order because they were not able to meet the deadline for delivering the work without the new machine?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n**Answer**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTime of delivery is vital to the performance of a sale of goods contract. Company A is entitled to damages if it can show that the late delivery caused actual business loss. If Company A has to pay a higher price for a new printing machine from another manufacturer to meet its printing deadlines, then it can also claim for the additional purchase price (provided that Company A has exercised reasonable effort to obtain the best offer in the market).\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Company A may not be entitled to claim for the loss of profits from the profitable order, as the order had not been converted into a formal contract and it is difficult for Company A to justify the loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n## [ANSWER TO SCENARIO 3](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/businessAndCommerce/case_illustration/Scenarios_in_Hong_Kong/Scenario_3)\n\n## SCENARIO 3\n\nMr. A and his brother Mr. B were partners in a garment manufacturing company business for many years. On the advice of their accountant, they formed a limited company (A & B Ltd) and invited Mr. B’s son to join them in the business. It was agreed that Mr. A and Mr. B would each hold 40% of the shares and that B’s son would hold the remaining 20%. Recently, Mr. A and Mr. B have been unable to agree on the design, quality of fabric or colour of their products, and consequently have neglected the business. They have failed to pay their suppliers and are unable to fulfil their contracted orders. Mr. B’s son always agrees with his father. As a result, Mr. A now refuses to communicate with either of them. Are there any grounds on which A & B Ltd can be wound up by the court?\n\n \n\n**Answer**\n\n \n\nA & B Ltd can be wound up by the court on any of the following grounds under [section 177(1)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/32/s177.html) of the [Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/32/):\n\n1. After the three owners have arranged to pay all of the outstanding amounts to their suppliers, they (as the members (shareholders) of A&B Ltd) pass a special resolution agreeing to have the company wound up by the court.\n2. The business of A&B Ltd has been suspended for a whole year.\n3. The debts that A&B Ltd owe to its suppliers exceed $10,000 and a statutory demand has been served on A&B Ltd and A&B Ltd has, for 3 weeks after the service, failed to pay the sum due.\n4. The court is of the opinion that it would be just and equitable for A&B Ltd to be wound up, as there is a breakdown of mutual trust and confidence among the three persons who are the shareholders and directors of A&B Ltd that prevents the proper management of the company.\n\nFor more information about the winding-up of a limited company, please go to the [Bankruptcy, Individual Voluntary Arrangement and Winding-up of Companies](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/bankruptcy_IndividualVoluntaryArrangement_Companies_Winding_up) topic.",

        "question": "INSTEAD OF SETTING UP A NEW BUSINESS, CAN I ACQUIRE AN ON-GOING BUSINESS? WHAT DO I HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND IF I INTEND TO DO THAT?",
        "answer": "Starting a small business can be a challenging and exciting experience. However, rather than building a business from ground zero, you may consider purchasing an existing and on-going one.\n\n \n\nThe advantages of acquiring an existing and on-going business are obvious. Just to name a few: the product or service is already on the market, the brand is probably well established, startup time can be significantly reduced, it is probably much easier to obtain financing, access to customer base is secured, etc. The purchaser just has to evaluate how much it is willing to pay for the business and find a seller who is willing to sell at a mutually agreed price.\n\n \n\nThe most straight forward way to acquire an on-going business is to acquire all the shares in the company which runs that business. The company’s entire rights, obligations and liabilities will be assumed by the purchaser. The purchaser of course has to conduct due diligence investigation on the subject company to make sure that it is buying what it really wants. The parties should then work on an agreement for sale and purchase of shares to stipulate items like price, completion date, warranties and representations by the seller, indemnity for tax liabilities, limitation of seller’s liability, etc. Depending on the size and complexity of operation of the subject company, the entire sale and purchase process can be very complicated and could take months to complete. Since this is not an easy task to go through the entire sale and purchase procedure without professional assistance, the purchaser and seller will be taking considerable risks if they do not engage professionals like accountant and lawyer in the process.\n\n \n\nIn cases where the purchaser only wants to acquire certain business(es) from a company instead of the entire company, the purchaser will be able to pick and choose which assets and liabilities it wishes to purchase. For example, a company may operate a chain of restaurants with different trade names; and a purchaser may be interested to acquire only one of the restaurants. In such circumstances, the parties will be dealing only with the sale and purchase of the business of that particular restaurant. This represents a transfer of business without any transfer of shares in the holding company. Apart from any agreements that the seller and the purchaser may make between themselves, the transaction will also be subject to the [Transfer of Business (Protection of Creditors) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/49/) ([Cap.49](https://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/49/)). This Ordinance provides that in a transfer of business, the purchaser will become liable for all the debts and obligations in relation to the carrying of the business unless the parties follow certain procedures set down by the Ordinance. The most significant procedure is that the parties have to publish a Notice of Transfer of Business in the Government Gazette not more than 4 months and not less than one month before the date the transfer takes effect. The Notice shall become complete upon the expiration of one month after its publication. The purchaser will cease to be liable for all obligations in relation to the business unless a creditor institutes proceedings against the seller in respect of any liability arising out of the business before the Notice becomes complete.\n\n \n\nIf the business is run by a sole proprietor or a partnership, the concept of share-acquisition will be irrelevant. In case of sale and purchase of such a business, the scenario is similar to that discussed in the last paragraph for acquisition of business. The parties should also strictly follow the procedures set down by the [Transfer of Business (Protection of Creditors) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/49/) ([Cap.49](https://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/49/)).",

        "question": "WHAT IF I AM MISREPRESENTED (MISLED) BY OTHERS IN ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT. WILL THE LAW HELP ME TO DISCHARGE THE CONTRACT OR CLAIM COMPENSATION?",
        "answer": "A person who makes a false statement of fact that induces ( or persuades) another person to enter into a contract is guilty of making a misrepresentation. The three pre-requisites for misrepresentation are: (i) someone has given a statement of fact, (ii) that statement is wrong, and (iii) that false statement induced the innocent party to enter into the contract.\n\n \n\nNote that a \"statement of fact\" is different from a \"statement of opinion\". For example, a car seller would only have given a statement of opinion if he told you that a van might be able to carry 1,000 kg of goods and asked you to try it before confirming your order. However, he would have made a statement of fact if he told you that the van had a 2,500 cc engine. The seller would be liable for misrepresentation if you confirmed your order as a result of his statement, but subsequently discovered that the actual capacity of the van's engine was only 1,500 cc.\n\n \n\nThe [Misrepresentation Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/284/) ([Cap. 284](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/284/) of the Laws of Hong Kong) allows the innocent party to apply to court to rescind the contract (cancel the contract and restore the parties to where they were before the contract was made) and to claim compensation.",

        "answer": "When a person or company sells products through sales agents, that person or company (as the principal) is liable for any contracts that are entered into by its agents, and may be sued on these contracts. The agent, who is not a party to the contracts, is generally not bound by the contracts between the principal and the other party. However, the agent may be personally liable if he acted without the necessary authority (did not act according to the principal's instruction).\n\n \n\n**The duties of the agent towards the principal include** acting in accordance with the principal's instructions with due care and skill, avoiding conflicts of interest, keeping confidential all aspects of the principal's business affairs (in particular avoiding the disclosure of confidential information to competitors), keeping proper accounts and disclosing any personal interest that might influence the principal in making the contract of agency.\n\n \n\n**The duties of the principal towards the agent include** paying the agreed remuneration (or the amount that the services are worth if not expressly stated in the agency contract), and indemnifying the agent for all liabilities and out-of pocket expenses that are reasonably incurred during the course of carrying out the agent's duties, unless such expenses are expressly excluded in the contract of agency.",

        "question": "WHAT SHOULD I BE AWARE OF BEFORE MAKING A CONTRACT WITH OTHERS THROUGH THE INTERNET?",
        "answer": "According to [section 17](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/553/s17.html) of the [Electronic Transactions Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/553/) ([Cap. 553](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/553/) of the Laws of Hong Kong), contracts can be made by means of electronic records (such as e-mails) unless otherwise agreed by the contracting parties. In addition, electronic records that can be accessed for subsequent reference are allowed as evidence in court proceedings, except those that are set out in [schedule 1](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/553/sch1.html) to the [Electronic Transactions Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/553/) such as wills, power of attorney, contracts for sale of land or real estate and mortgages.\n\n \n\nIf the contract requires the signatures of the parties (but does not involve government organisations), then the parties can use any form of electronic signature that is reliable, appropriate and agreed by the recipient of the signature. For example, the parties may sign a hard copy, scan the document into a computer and then send it via e-mail. If the contract involves government or banking services, the parties must use \"digital signatures\", which are supported by a recognised certificate that is issued by the Postmaster General. For more information about digital signatures, please go to the [website](http://www.hongkongpost.gov.hk/product/ecert/usage/index.html) of the Hongkong Post.\n\n \n\nIf a contract is made between two persons or companies in different countries over the Internet, then that contract will be enforced by the law of the place with the closest connection to the contract (*** note**). In terms of taxation, the tax law of the place where the profits are made will apply (unless otherwise stated). For example, if you ship your goods to Japan and sell them there, then you will be liable for Japanese tax. However, this is only the basic rule. You should consult an expert in that field before proceeding with such business.\n\n \n\n(*** Note**: In determining which place has the closest connection to the contract, the common law generally takes the following factors into consideration: the place of contracting, the place where the contractual duties are performed, the places of residence or businesses of the parties, and the nature and subject matter of the contract. However, the courts stress that these factors are not exhaustive, and that any other factors which are relevant to the contract may also be considered. You should therefore seek legal advice if there is a query or dispute.)\n\n \n\nCare must also be taken when submitting personal information through the Internet. The Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) provides for specific controls over the use of the data by merchants and the rights of consumers to access their own data. You can obtain more information concerning this matter from the [Personal Data Privacy](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/personalDataPrivacy/) topic.",

        "question": "INSTEAD OF SETTING UP A NEW BUSINESS, CAN I ACQUIRE AN ON-GOING BUSINESS? WHAT DO I HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND IF I INTEND TO DO THAT?",
        "answer": "Starting a small business can be a challenging and exciting experience. However, rather than building a business from ground zero, you may consider purchasing an existing and on-going one.\n\n \n\nThe advantages of acquiring an existing and on-going business are obvious. Just to name a few: the product or service is already on the market, the brand is probably well established, startup time can be significantly reduced, it is probably much easier to obtain financing, access to customer base is secured, etc. The purchaser just has to evaluate how much it is willing to pay for the business and find a seller who is willing to sell at a mutually agreed price.\n\n \n\nThe most straight forward way to acquire an on-going business is to acquire all the shares in the company which runs that business. The company’s entire rights, obligations and liabilities will be assumed by the purchaser. The purchaser of course has to conduct due diligence investigation on the subject company to make sure that it is buying what it really wants. The parties should then work on an agreement for sale and purchase of shares to stipulate items like price, completion date, warranties and representations by the seller, indemnity for tax liabilities, limitation of seller’s liability, etc. Depending on the size and complexity of operation of the subject company, the entire sale and purchase process can be very complicated and could take months to complete. Since this is not an easy task to go through the entire sale and purchase procedure without professional assistance, the purchaser and seller will be taking considerable risks if they do not engage professionals like accountant and lawyer in the process.\n\n \n\nIn cases where the purchaser only wants to acquire certain business(es) from a company instead of the entire company, the purchaser will be able to pick and choose which assets and liabilities it wishes to purchase. For example, a company may operate a chain of restaurants with different trade names; and a purchaser may be interested to acquire only one of the restaurants. In such circumstances, the parties will be dealing only with the sale and purchase of the business of that particular restaurant. This represents a transfer of business without any transfer of shares in the holding company. Apart from any agreements that the seller and the purchaser may make between themselves, the transaction will also be subject to the [Transfer of Business (Protection of Creditors) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/49/) ([Cap.49](https://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/49/)). This Ordinance provides that in a transfer of business, the purchaser will become liable for all the debts and obligations in relation to the carrying of the business unless the parties follow certain procedures set down by the Ordinance. The most significant procedure is that the parties have to publish a Notice of Transfer of Business in the Government Gazette not more than 4 months and not less than one month before the date the transfer takes effect. The Notice shall become complete upon the expiration of one month after its publication. The purchaser will cease to be liable for all obligations in relation to the business unless a creditor institutes proceedings against the seller in respect of any liability arising out of the business before the Notice becomes complete.\n\n \n\nIf the business is run by a sole proprietor or a partnership, the concept of share-acquisition will be irrelevant. In case of sale and purchase of such a business, the scenario is similar to that discussed in the last paragraph for acquisition of business. The parties should also strictly follow the procedures set down by the [Transfer of Business (Protection of Creditors) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/49/) ([Cap.49](https://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/49/)).",

The application may be submitted via the online application portal on the Hong Kong Police website, or by submitting it to the Police Licensing Office in person or by mail.\n\n \n\nFor a transfer of licence, any person may apply in writing to the Commissioner of Police to transfer an existing licence to another person and such transfer shall be endorsed on the licence. The Commissioner may, if he is satisfied that sufficient cause is shown, approve and permit such application for transfer.\n\n \n\nIf a pawnbroker intends to transfer its business as a pawnbroker from the original premises (the address of which is stated on the licence) to another premises, he may apply in writing to the Commissioner of Police to have the new premises endorsed on its licence in substitution of the original premises.\n\n \n\nIn order to make any change or amendment to the details stated on the licence, the licensee must apply to the Commissioner of Police for approval.\n\n \n\nThe current fees for a licence are as follows:\n\n\n\n| **New Issue/ Renewal Application** | HK$5,070 |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Application for Transfer of Licence/ Change of Premises/ Amendments to Licence** | HK$155 |\n\n \n\nAny person who wishes to contest the decision of the Commissioner of Police regarding an application for a licence, a transfer of licence or substitution of premises or a renewal of licence may appeal by way of petition to the Chief Executive within 28 days from the date of the decision.

Therefore, Mr. A must prove that what he published was true within the framework of the meanings of the words he used as determined by the jury, and not some possibly uncommon or obscure meaning that he himself might have attributed to the words in question.\n\n \n\nThe general principle is that the law does not allow one to recover damages for an injury to a character that one does not possess.

        "answer": "Any words that may tend to cause a person to be hated or despised defame him. However, as pointed out in *Gatley on Libel and Slander (10 th Edition* ), words that may expose a person to ridicule may present some difficulty in deciding if the words are defamatory. Some degree of humour at the expense of others may be part of normal life. Words that do not diminish one's standing with others cannot be relied on as grounds for commencing a defamation lawsuit.\n\n \n\nIn a British case *( [Berkoff v Burchill & Anor.](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1996/564.html)**)* , Berkoff, a well-known actor, director and writer, was referred to in one article as a *“notoriously hideous-looking person”* . In the second article, a character in the film called \"the Creature\" was referred to and equated to the plaintiff by *“[the Creature]'s a lot like [Berkoff], only marginally better-looking”* . The plaintiff claimed that the statements made were defamatory as they meant and were understood to mean that Berkoff was *“hideously ugly”* . Application was made to dismiss the action on the grounds that the statements might only cause injury to feeling or cause annoyance, which was irrelevant to an action for defamation. However, the Court was of the view that to make such a statement about someone in the public eyes who made his living as an actor could be considered defamatory, since the statement was capable of lowering the actor's standing in the estimation of a right-thinking member of the public and capable of making him an object of ridicule. The Court ruled that it was inappropriate to withdraw the matter from the consideration of a jury.\n\n \n\nLegally speaking, if a nick name used to refer to, or to address, another person is capable of lowering a person's standing in the estimation of the public and of making that person an object of ridicule, the victim can use this as grounds for instituting defamation proceedings.\n\n \n\nHowever, in practice, when you consider the level of damage/suffering together with the potential costs in legal fees and time, it may not be rational to commence a defamation lawsuit over an unwanted nick name.\n\nLast revision date:\n\n \n\n27 February, 2020",

        "answer": "If one person speaks to another person once, this counts as one publication. When the latter repeats the same thing to yet another person, it is a second publication. The second publication is a fresh instance of defamation (if the content is defamatory).\n\n \n\nMerely quoting other people's words is regarded in law as publication. If the words are defamatory, the one who merely repeated those words is liable for defamation.

        "answer": "Generally speaking, the writer would only be responsible for the publication of the defamatory article to the particular person to whom the letter was addressed. However, if the writer, given the circumstances of the case, knew that there was a likelihood that the letter could be opened and read by other persons, the writer may be liable for the publication of the defamatory article to those other persons ( *Gatley on Libel and Slander [10 th Edition]* ).\n\n \n\nThere was a case in which the defendant sent a letter to the owner of a firm not knowing that there were other people in the office. The letter was opened by a clerk of the firm and was read by three other clerks in the office. The Court held that the defendant should have considered that his letter might, in the ordinary course of the firm's business, be opened and read by a clerk. If he took no precaution to prevent this (e.g. marking the envelope with the words \"private and confidential\"), he was responsible for the publication.\n\nLast revision date:\n\n \n\n27 February, 2020",

If this is the case, you (as the employer) may also be liable for defamation.\n\n \n\nUnder [section 8](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/21/s8.html) of the [Defamation Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/21/), if you are an employer who is vicariously liable for your employees' acts, you may have the chance to rebut the above presumption (i.e. to make a successful defence) by proving that the publication was made without your authority, consent, or knowledge, and that you have not been negligent yourself (e.g. you or the person in charge of the job had duly checked the article before publishing it).\n\nLast revision date:\n\n \n\n27 February, 2020",

        "question": "IN A PUBLIC PLACE, PERSON C TALKED TO PERSON B IN A LOUD VOICE, ACCUSING A 3RD PARTY (A) OF SOME WRONG DOING. THE CONVERSATION WAS DEFAMATORY OF A. WHAT C SAID WAS RECORDED BY A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO THEN UPLOADED THE CONVERSATION TO A WEBSITE ON THE INTERNET. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, C WILL BE LIABLE FOR THE PUBLICATION OF THOSE DEFAMATORY WORDS AGAINST A WHEN HIS CONVERSATION IS HEARD BY THE PUBLIC. HOWEVER, WHEN THE PUBLIC HEAR WHAT C SAID ON THE INTERNET, WHO WILL BE LIABLE FOR THE PUBLICATION OF THE DEFAMATORY WORDS?",
        "answer": "A person is liable for unintentional publication of defamatory matter to a third party unless the person can show that such publication did not occur due to any want of care (lack of care) on his part.\n\n \n\nExample: If C drops a defamatory letter on the street and B picks it up and reads it, C will be liable for the publication of the defamatory letter to B since such publication was due to his want of care in his custody of the document. (When he transports a letter, he has the duty to keep the letter confidential. If he carelessly dropped the letter and it is read by a passer-by, he would have breached this duty and therefore he would be liable for unintentional publication of defamatory matter.)\n\n \n\nApplying the same principle to the subject question, C will be liable if he speaks in a loud voice (using defamatory words) in a public place allowing passers-by to overhear what he says.\n\n \n\n***Will C be liable for a defamatory conversation that was recorded and uploaded onto the Internet secretly by another person?\\***\n\n \n\nIf person C can prove that he did not know a member of the public was recording the conversation and that he did not have any reason to suppose that someone within hearing distance would record it and place it on an internet website, he may not be liable for the second publication of the defamatory material on the Internet. However, due to the present advancement of technology, it is easy to record a conversation and upload it onto the Internet. This may increase the difficulty that C would have in putting the above defence forward.\n\n \n\n***Will the person who uploaded the defamatory conversation to the Internet incur any legal liability?\\***\n\n \n\nThe member of public who recorded the defamatory conversation, and who placed the recorded conversation on the Internet and made the recording available to the public, has repeated the defamatory words to others. Referring to the [answer to question 1](http://wwwnew.clic.org.hk/en/topics/defamation/conveying_defamatory_matter/q1), a second/repeated publication is a fresh instance of defamation. In that case, that member of public will be liable for the publication of that defamatory conversation.\n\n \n\nThe liability of the internet website (or the person/company that hosts the website) which contains the defamatory conversation will be discussed in [the next question](http://wwwnew.clic.org.hk/en/topics/defamation/conveying_defamatory_matter/q7).\n\nLast revision date:\n\n \n\n27 February, 2020",

        "question": "IF DEFAMATORY WORDS ABOUT A PERSON WERE PLACED ON AN INTERNET WEBSITE BY USERS/VIEWERS OF THE WEBSITE, WILL THAT WEBSITE (OR THE PERSON/COMPANY IN CHARGE OF IT) BE LIABLE FOR DEFAMATION?",
        "answer": "At common law, some protection is given to persons who are not the author, printer or the first or main publisher of defamatory materials. There is also a statutory defence under [section 25(5)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/21/s25.html) of the [Defamation Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/21/) for unintentional defamation if the defendant (i.e. the publisher) can prove that:\n\n \n\n1. he did not intend to publish the words of and concerning the person, and did not know of the circumstances that they might be understood to refer to that person; OR\n2. the words were not defamatory on the surface and the publisher did not know of the circumstances under which they might be understood to be defaming that person; AND\n3. all reasonable care has been taken by the publisher to avoid any defamatory material in the publication; AND\n4. in order to avoid or reduce the liability for unintentional defamation, the publisher has to make an \"offer of amends\" under [section 25](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/21/s25.html) of the [Defamation Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/21/).\n\n(Note: \"Offer of amends\" generally means that the defendant offers to give a formal apology to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff can decide whether or not to accept this offer. A common example of executing an offer of amends is to publish a notice of correction regarding the words complained of, together with a statement of apology, in a newspaper.)\n\n \n\nGenerally speaking, when defamatory materials have been left on a website by internet users, that website (or the person/company/internet service provider in charge of it) may be liable as the publisher of said defamatory materials if they take no action to remove the defamatory materials from the website .\n\n \n\nIn a British case, an internet service provider received and kept on its website an article which contained defamatory materials concerning the plaintiff (who is a lecturer in physics, mathematics and computer science). The article was posted by an unknown person using another service provider. The lecturer had approached the defendant (the internet service provider) requesting it to remove the article from its website. The defendant did not do so and the article remained available on the website until its automatic expiry, some 10 days afterwards. The court held that an internet service provider was a publisher of the material which it \"hosts\" where it was aware that the material was defamatory. The judge even suggested that, whenever they transmit and whenever there is transmitted from the storage of their news server a defamatory posting, the provider publish that posting to any subscribers to their internet service provider who accesses the newsgroup containing that posting. Every time one of the provider's customers accesses the website and sees the posting defaming the lecturer, it constitutes a publication to that customer.\n\nLast revision date:\n\n \n\n27 February, 2020",

        "question": "IF I DID NOT INTEND TO REFER TO THE PLAINTIFF IN MY ARTICLE, AND IT WAS A PURE COINCIDENCE THAT THE ARTICLE APPEARS TO REFER TO HIM, WILL I STILL BE LIABLE FOR DEFAMATION?",
        "answer": "At [common law](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary), it is immaterial that the defendant did not intend to refer to the plaintiff, or did not even know of his existence. According to *Gatley on Libel and Slander [10th edition],* the test is \"would the words complained of be understood by reasonable people who knew the plaintiff to refer to him?\" If so, the words complained of are published about and concerning the plaintiff, no matter what intention the defendant may have had.\n\n \n\nIf you are being sued for defamation, you cannot make a successful defence by showing that you did not intend to defame the plaintiff when in fact you have done so.\n\n \n\nIn a British case, the defendant published an article defaming a named person believed by the author and the editor to be a fictitious person with an unusual name. The name was in fact that of the plaintiff, a barrister in practice. Neither the author nor the editor of the article intended to refer to the plaintiff. They even swore that they did not know of his existence. The judge had directed the jury to decide the case on the facts, not the intentions of the defendant. If the jury thought that any reasonable people reading the article would think it referred only to a fictitious person, then the article could not be considered defamatory. However, if the jury thought that reasonable persons who knew of the existence of the plaintiff would think that it referred to him, the jury ought to find for the plaintiff (i.e. the defendant is liable for defamation) and it was immaterial whether the article was intended by the author or the editor to refer to the plaintiff or not.\n\nLast revision date:\n\n \n\n27 February, 2020",

        "question": "WOULD I BE LIABLE FOR DEFAMATION IF I PUBLISHED DEFAMATORY WORDS OR ALLEGATIONS ABOUT A LIMITED COMPANY? HOW ABOUT PUBLISHING DEFAMATORY WORDS OR ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT?",
        "answer": "A limited company or a corporation (which is incorporated under the [Companies Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/622/)) is generally considered as a separate legal entity, and is sometimes treated as an \"artificial person\". A limited company can either sue, or be sued by the others. It can also sign contracts or own property under its name.\n\n \n\nIf defamatory statements have harmed the reputation of a limited company, the company can sue for defamation. However, both the government and government organizations do not have the right to sue for defamation. (However, you are warned that if the defamatory statements refer to a particular government official , that official may personally sue for defamation.)\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, the situation regarding a public body (like a university) may be different. There has been a local case ( [Hong Kong Polytechnic University & Ors. v Next Magazine Publishi n g Ltd. & Anor.](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/1997/594.html)) in which the Polytechnic University sued a magazine for defamation. The article in question was about the qualifications of the academic staff of the Polytechnic University and their terms of appointment. The magazine argued that if the court allowed the University to sue on this basis, it would be contrary to the right to freedom of the press as guaranteed under [the Bill of Rights Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/383/). This rationale was accepted by the Court of First Instance of the High Court. The Court ordered the Polytechnic University to cease suing the magazine. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the reputation of the Polytechnic University required protection just like a limited company, and it held that the Polytechnic University had the right to bring legal action against the magazine.\n\nLast revision date:\n\n \n\n27 February, 2020",

        "question": "MY RIVAL IS SPREADING RUMOURS THAT GOODS SUPPLIED BY MY COMPANY ARE DEFECTIVE. THESE RUMOURS ARE AFFECTING MY BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO STOP IT?",
        "answer": "Yes. Under these circumstances, you (as the plaintiff) can apply for an injunction, whether interim or permanent, to prevent further publication of the libelous or slanderous statements or materials.\n\n \n\nAn interim injunction is a court order restraining the defendant (in this case, the defendant is the person spreading or publishing the rumours) from further publication of said rumours pending the outcome of full legal proceedings (a trial) in court. That is to say, if the interim order is granted by a court, the defendant will be forbidden to continue to publish the matter under dispute until the court has made a final judgment on whether or not the defendant is liable for defamation. The court may grant such an order when it appears to be just and convenient to do so.\n\n \n\nWith reference to *Gatley on Libel and Slander [10th edition]* , an injunction is also appropriate in cases of malicious falsehood (i.e. the defendant intentionally made false statements in order to harm the plaintiff or its business) where:\n\n \n\n1. the plaintiff can prove that the content of the publication by the defendant is false;\n2. it refers to the plaintiff or its business;\n3. it was published maliciously; and\n4. financial loss will follow as a natural and direct result of the publication.\n\nFor more details on how to apply to a court for an injunction, please go to another topic – bringing or defending a civil case.

        "answer": "You can try to recover part of your salary or to get a certain amount of compensation in the following ways.\n\n \n\ni) Bankruptcy or Winding-up proceedings\n\n \n\nIf an employee is owed wages, wages in lieu of notice, severance payment or other contractual sums by the employer, then the employee can (as a creditor) apply to the Court for a bankruptcy order (if the insolvent employer is not a limited company) or a winding-up order (if the insolvent employer is a limited company).\n\n \n\nUpon the making of a bankruptcy order or a winding-up order by the Court, the trustee or the provisional liquidator (who is normally the Official Receiver) takes immediate steps to recover and preserve the employer's assets. Those assets are normally sold by the trustee or liquidator, and the proceeds of sale, after the deduction of necessary expenses, are used to pay debts owed to the employer's creditors. If you want to know more about bankruptcy or winding-up proceedings, please go to the topic Bankruptcy and Winding-up.\n\n \n\nIf you have successfully obtained a bankruptcy order or winding-up order from the Court, then you are entitled to receive payment out of your employer's assets in preference (with priority) to most other creditors of your employer in respect of wages, wages in lieu of notice and severance payments under the statutory limit. In the preference debts, you can recover wages up to a maximum of $8,000. You can also recover wages in lieu of notice (not exceeding one month's wages or $2,000 whichever is the lesser) and severance payments not exceeding $8,000.\n\n \n\nHowever, any arrears of wages, wages in lieu of notice or severance payments that exceed the statutory limit are non-preferential debts, and the employee is treated as an ordinary creditor on claiming that exceeded amount.\n\n \n\nIn view of the time limit for wages to qualify for preferential payment in bankruptcy or winding-up proceedings, you should not delay taking legal action by relying on any mere promises by your employer or by some third party to pay your arrears of wages at a future date. This may result in the loss of entitlement to receive payment as a preferential creditor if the promises to pay are not kept.\n\n \n\nFor more information regarding employer insolvency, please see the Labour Department's webpage.\n\n \n\nii) Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund\n\n \n\nDuring the bankruptcy or winding-up proceedings against your employer, you can also apply for ex-gratia payment from the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund (\"the Fund\"). The Fund is administered by the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund Board, and covers:\n\narrears of wages (during the four months before the last day of the employee's service) with a maximum amount of $36,000;\nwages in lieu of notice (up to the equivalent of one month's wages) with the maximum amount of $22,500; and\nseverance payment with the maximum amount of $50,000 plus 50% of any excess entitlement.\n \n\nThe Commissioner for Labour will NOT approve any application for these payments for:\n\nwages for service rendered more than 4 months before the last day of service;\nwages for which the relevant application is made more than 6 months after the last day of service;\nwages in lieu of notice or severance payment for which the relevant application is made more than 6 months after the date of termination of the employment contract.\nFor more information about the Fund, please see the Labour Department's webpage.",

        "answer": "To implement wage reductions, an employer must obtain the consent of the employees in advance. Unilaterally reducing wages without the employee’s agreement will contravene the law with respect to timely payment of wages. If wages are not paid within one month after they become due, the employees may deem their contracts of employment to be terminated by their employer without notice and they will be entitled to payment in lieu of notice in addition to other statutory and contractual termination payment.\n\n \n\nIf employers must arrange no-pay leave for their employees due to special needs of the business, they will possibly be liable for severance payment to eligible employees. An employee will be taken to be laid off if the total number of days on which no work is provided, and no wages is paid exceeds half of the total number of normal working days in any four 4 consecutive weeks or one-third of the total number of normal working days in any 26 consecutive weeks. An employee with not less than 24 months of employment under a continuous contract is eligible for severance payment when being laid off.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, an employee employed under a continuous contract may claim for remedies under sections 32L to 32Q of the Employment Ordinance against an employer if the contract terms are varied without the employee’s consent, the employment contract does not expressly allow such a variation and the contract terms are varied without one of the five valid reasons as specified in section 32K of the Employment Ordinance.\n\n \n\nAs to the five valid reasons in section 32K of the Employment Ordinance, see: “Unreasonable Variation of Employment”.\n\n \n\nThe remedies for unreasonable variation of the terms of the employment contract include an order for reinstatement or re-engagement, an award of terminal payments and an award of compensation; for detail, see: “If I (as an employee) am facing unreasonable dismissal or unreasonable variation of the terms of my employment contract, then what can I do to protect my rights?”.",

        "question": "Do employees need to serve notices of termination or make payments in lieu of notice if I back out of accepted job offers prior to their commencement dates?",
        "answer": "If a person backs out of an accepted job offer before the commencement date, he or she is not an “employee” at that time and there is no way he or she can give any “notice”. That person will be liable to the employer for damages for breach of contract.\n\n \n\nHowever, if the wording of the employment contract has the following effect, that person must give a notice or payment in lieu of notice to back out prior to the commencement date:\n\n \n\na. The employment contract is drafted in the manner that a reasonable person would have understood that the provision on the notice period or payment in lieu of notice would come into effect immediately upon acceptance of the offer; and\n\nb. the obligation to pay in lieu of the notice is a primary obligation where the provision provides a mechanism for termination of the contract, such that the employer may claim against the employee for the amount as a contractual debt as opposed to a remedy for breach of contract. The term “primary obligation” refers to the contractual provision that expressly provides a mechanism for termination of the contract.\n\n \n\nIn the following case, the Court of Appeal held that the particular contract in question has the above effect: Law Ting Pong Secondary School v. Chen Wai Wah (CACV517/2019, 11 June 2021).",

        "answer": "With reference to section 10 of the Employment Ordinance, employees can terminate their employment contracts without advance notice or payment in lieu of notice if they:\n\n \n\nreasonably fear physical danger by violence or disease when performing job duties;\nare subjected to ill-treatment by their employers; or\nhave been employed for not less than five years and are certified as being permanently unfit for the type of work in their employment.\n \n\nThere is a High Court case (William Barry Preen v Industries Polytex Ltd.) which could help explain the circumstances of ill-treatment by employer. In this case the victim, who was an assistant general manager of a company, was being asked by the company to resign. After his refusal to resign, he was ordered to work in a dyeing room instead of an office. Also, he was ordered to vacate his independent apartment provided by the company, and had to share a quarter of the same size with other staff. The Court viewed that those arrangements had caused substantial changes in the employment conditions to the detriment of employee, and they were made with bad faith and in a disrespectful manner.\n\n \n\nIf you can justify that the moving of heavy goods will cause you physical danger or that such order constitutes serious ill treatment of you, then you can resign without giving advance notice or wages in lieu of notice.\n\n \n\nIf you are not sure about your position, please contact the Labour Relations Division of the Labour Department at 2717 1771 for further information, or consult your own lawyer.",

        "answer": "An employer is prohibited from dismissing a pregnant employee from the date on which she is confirmed pregnant by a medical certificate to the date on which she is due to return to work upon the expiry of her maternity leave if:\n\n \n\nthe employee has been employed under a continuous contract, and\nshe has served a notice of pregnancy to her employer.\n \n\nIf a pregnant employee is dismissed by her employer before she has served a notice of pregnancy, then she may serve such notice immediately after being informed of her dismissal. Under such circumstances, her employer must withdraw the dismissal or the notice of dismissal.\n\n \n\nHowever, employers are not prohibited from dismissing pregnant employees under the following circumstances:\n\n \n\nthe employee is summarily dismissed due to serious misconduct; or\nwhere it has been expressly agreed that the employment is on probation, the employee is dismissed for reasons other than pregnancy during the probation period of not more than 12 weeks.\nThe judgment from the Court of Final Appeal in the case of Hong Kong Ming Wah Shipping Company Ltd v Sun Min also mentioned that a pregnant employee has the right to remain in her employment and, subject to certain conditions, to receive the prescribed payments during the period of protection. The judgment further explained that there is no basis for cutting down this protection by pointing to an offer of an alternative employment under a new contract with some other entity (company/business organisation), albeit an entity which is a member of the same group of companies.\n\n \n\nOffences and Penalties\n\n \n\nExcept for the circumstances provided above, it is an offence for employers to dismiss pregnant employees. Employers who do so are liable to prosecution and, on conviction, to a fine of $100,000. Employers are also required to pay the following sums of money to the dismissed employee within 7 days after the day of termination:\n\n \n\nwages in lieu of notice;\na further sum equivalent to one month's wages; and\n14 weeks' maternity leave pay if, but for the dismissal, she would have been entitled to such a payment.\n \n\nYou can also claim remedies/compensations against your employer if you were dismissed other than for a valid reason as specified in the Employment Ordinance (please refer to the Q&A for \"Unreasonable and unlawful termination\" ).",

        "question": "IF THE PARTIES CANNOT REACH AN AMICABLE SETTLEMENT AT THE FIRST HEARING, HOW CAN I BE PREPARED FOR THE SUBSEQUENT TRIAL?",
        "answer": "Please note that you are not allowed to appoint a lawyer to represent you at the Labour Tribunal. You normally have to attend the trial on your own. Subject to the approval of the t ribunal, an office bearer of a registered trade union or an association of employers (who has obtained your written authorization) can attend the trial as your representative. **You may also seek legal advice before attending the trial** **.**\n\n \n\nHere are some general points that you should note:\n\n \n\n**A) Date, time and place of the trial**\n\n \n\nYou can check the above information from the [Judiciary webpage](https://e-services.judiciary.hk/dcl/index.jsp?lang=en). You can also call the Labour Tribunal Registry at 26250020 to confirm the details.\n\n \n\nThe trial will not start before the time you have been given and you may have to wait. However, you are recommended to arrive earlier for preparation.\n\n \n\n**B) Language**\n\n \n\nChinese and English are the official languages in Hong Kong. If the situation requires, an interpreter will be provided by the tribunal. If you give evidence in a language other than English or Chinese (Cantonese), the tribunal will find a suitable interpreter for you. But you should inform the tribunal officer as early as possible for making the necessary arrangement.\n\n \n\n**C) Addressing the judge, the witnesses and your opponent**\n\n \n\nThe trial at the Labour Tribunal will be heard by a \"Presiding Officer\". The party who brings up the claim to the tribunal is called the \"Claimant\", and the other party is called the \"Defendant\".\n\n \n\nDuring the trial, it is perfectly acceptable for you to address the Presiding Officer as \"Sir/Madam\" or \"Your Honour\". You should address the witnesses and your opponent as \"Mr.\", \"Mrs.\" or \"Miss\". Always remember not to use threatening or insulting words during the trial.\n\n \n\n**D) Dress Code**\n\n \n\nYou should dress neatly when attending the trial. If possible, avoid wearing T-shirts and jeans.\n\n \n\n**E) Witness**\n\n \n\nA witness is a person having personal knowledge of facts relating to the matters in dispute in a case. You may try to find as many witnesses as possible to support your case but you should make sure that they are reliable. One good witness will often be more convincing than several unreliable witnesses.\n\n \n\nIf your intended witness is unwilling to attend the trial, you may request the tribunal to subpoena him/her (i.e. to order the witness to attend the trial and give evidence). You should check with the tribunal officers for the necessary arrangement.\n\n \n\nThere are occasions where the evidence involves technical opinions from the experts e.g. explaining medical reports. You may get the assistance from expert witnesses. But you have to apply for leave (permission) from the tribunal to call expert witnesses at the trial. Addition costs will inevitably be incurred for calling expert witnesses.\n\n \n\nBefore attending the trial, you must talk to your intended witnesses in order to assess their credibility, see what they have known about your case and what they will probably say at the trial. However, you must not try to make up the answers for them. Bad inference would be drawn by the tribunal if your witnesses are just reading out your \"scripts\" during the trial. **If it is proved that a person has wilfully given false evidence, he/she will be liable to a fine and imprisonment.**\n\n \n\nYou may briefly tell your witnesses what you are going to ask at the trial and the possibility of being questioned by your opponent and the Presiding Officer. This could help reduce your witnesses' anxiety and they could have better preparations before entering the courtroom.\n\n \n\nYou should also remind your witnesses not to turn to you for looks of approval when answering questions from the Presiding Officer or your opponent.\n\n \n\n**F) Submitting evidence**\n\n \n\nBesides the oral evidence given at the trial, you may also submit materials relating to the case (e.g. documents, photographs or audio visual recordings) to the tribunal as supporting evidence. Your witnesses (if any) may also prepare written statements before the commencement of the trial. You can download some general guidelines for preparing **witness statement** from the [Resource Centre for Unrepresented Litigants](http://rcul.judiciary.gov.hk/rc/eng/sform.jsp)\n\n \n\nWhether or not the evidence is admissible (accepted by the tribunal) will be decided by the Presiding Officer. Remember to prepare extra copies for your opponent.\n\n \n\nAccording to [section 27(2)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/25/s27.html) of the [Labour Tribunal Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/25/), **the rules of evidence shall not apply to proceedings in the tribunal and it may receive any evidence which it considers relevant** . In other words, you need not worry about the strict rules and legal formalities (which must be observed by lawyers in other courts) when submitting evidence to the tribunal. The Presiding Officer will give you appropriate instructions. Nevertheless, you must not give false evidence to the tribunal.\n\n \n\n**G) Procedures for the trial**\n\n \n\nAs you are not allowed to have legal representation, the Presiding Officer will introduce the procedures and the law relating to your case right at the beginning of the trial. If you feel unsecured before attending the trial, you may ask the tribunal officers to provide some preliminary information about the procedures.\n\n \n\nGenerally speaking, the procedures may include:\n\n \n\n| **Examination in chief** | Usually, the Claimant will give evidence first and call witnesses to give evidence (they will be questioned by the Claimant). Alternatively, the Claimant may just call his/her witnesses to give evidence. This process is called \"examination in chief\" by the Claimant. |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Cross- examination**   | The Defendant may put questions to each of the Claimant's witnesses after he/she has given evidence. This process is called \"cross-examination\" by the Defendant. |\n| **Re-examination**       | After cross-examination by the Defendant, the Claimant may put questions to his/her witnesses to clarify the matters raised in the cross-examination. This process is called \"re-examination\" by the Claimant.After all witnesses of the Claimant have given evidence, the Defendant may give evidence and call his/her witnesses to give evidence (examination in chief by the Defendant).

The Presiding Officer can always give other directions which you must follow.**\n- At any stage the Presiding Officer may also ask you (or the witnesses) questions.\n- You can remain seated when talking to the Presiding Officer and the other parties.\n\n**H) Things to note when you question the witnesses and your opponent**\n\n \n\n- Before the commencement of the trial, prepare the questions and make relevant notes of all you want to say at the tribunal.\n- If you have several witnesses to call, give a list of witnesses to the tribunal before the trial.\n- Avoid using jargons or technical languages. If they must be used, explain them first.\n- Ask short and specific question. Don't ask two things at a time, e.g. \"When did you meet him and what did he tell you at the meeting?\" Instead, you should ask two separate questions: \"When did you meet him?\" and \"What did he tell you at the meeting?\"\n- When you question your own witnesses (examination in chief), avoid asking questions to which you do not know the answers. That is why you have to interview your witnesses before the trial and see what they have known about your case.\n- Do not repeat the questions that have already been asked by your opponent (unless the previous answers were not clear).\n- Do not quarrel with the witnesses and your opponent.\n- Your questions should focus on seeking factual information instead of opinions (unless you are questioning an expert witness). Asking for opinions may lead to lengthy and unfavourable replies.\n- If you do not question your opponent's witnesses (cross-examination), it may imply that you have no objection to their oral evidence. However, don't just trying to ask trivial or irrelevant questions to show that you \"object\" their evidence. This may irritate the Presiding Officer and cause adverse effect on your case. This principle also applies when you are cross examining your opponent.\n- If your opponent's witness has given your desired answer, turn to the next question (or end your cross-examination) immediately. Do not allow the witness to explain more.\n- If your questions are unclear, the Presiding Officer may interrupt and help you rephrase the questions. He/she may also stop you from asking questions which are totally irrelevant to the case.\n- If you notice that the Presiding Officer is taking notes, slow down your speech a little bit.\n\n**I) Answering questions**\n\n \n\nAll you need to do is to answer questions honestly and truthfully. You should try to avoid giving long answers, and should speak clearly at all times. Make a note of what you want to say so that you can refer to it.\n\n \n\nIf you do not understand or cannot hear a question, ask for it to be repeated. If you genuinely do not know the answer to a question you should say so. Do not attempt to make up an answer. If you deliberately lie in your evidence, you will commit the offence of perjury (wilfully giving false evidence) for which you may be prosecuted.",

        "answer": "The Tribunal may specify how the judgment debtor is to make payment to the judgment creditor. If the judgment debtor fails to pay, then the judgment creditor may apply to the Tribunal for a Certificate of Award. This can be registered in the District Court within 12 months from the date of the award. The judgment creditor can then apply to the District Court for the court bailiff to enforce the judgment. (For example, the bailiff can seize the debtor’s goods and chattels at the debtor’s premises. The seized items will then be sold by public auction. The proceeds from the auction (after the deduction of necessary expenses) will be used to pay debts.)\n\n \n\nIf the judgment cannot be enforced because the judgment debtor is insolvent or has disappeared, then you can consider applying for an ex-gratia payment from the [Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund](http://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/erb/content4.htm).",

        "question": "I ACCEPTED A NEW JOB OFFER FROM A COMPANY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT I WOULD BEGIN WORK ON A CERTAIN DATE. I GAVE ONE MONTH NOTICE TO MY CURRENT EMPLOYER TO TERMINATE MY EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT. ONE WEEK BEFORE I WAS TO BEGIN MY NEW JOB, I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM THE NEW COMPANY STATING THAT THEY WERE HOLDING OFF ON ANY NEW RECRUITMENT AS THEY WERE BRINGING NEW INVESTORS IN. SINCE I HAD ALREADY GIVEN NOTICE TO MY CURRENT EMPLOYER (AND NEW PERSON HIRED AND TRAINED), I WAS LEFT WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT. IS THERE ANY RECOURSE TO TAKE AGAINST THE COMPANY THAT OFFERED ME THE NEW JOB?",
        "answer": "To begin with, the answer provided herein is based on the following assumptions:\n\n \n\n1. you signed a valid employment contract with the new company;\n2. that company had made it clearly and unequivocally that they did not want your service despite signing the valid contract; and\n3. **there is no probation period**\n\nInsofar as (ii) is concerned, you should have asked the company for a formal letter to clarify its position instead of just reading an e-mail.\n\n \n\nThe starting point for you is to peruse the contract with the company. There may be an express clause that governs the right and obligation of both parties under the present situation. In the absence of such a get-out clause, which is often the case, you may treat the requirements (e.g. the length of notice, or the amount of wages in lieu of notice) in the same way as a continuous contract of employment.\n\n \n\nIf there is a probation period, the answer will depend on the exact content of the contractual provision. Some contracts may provide that during the first month of employment, the employer has the right to terminate you without the need to give a reason or a notice period. In that case, even if you report for duty, the company will terminate your employment right away.  \n\n \n\nIf you have already accepted the new job offer verbally and a binding contract is formed, the answers in all the paragraphs above will apply even though you have not signed a written employment contract. The question whether a binding contract has been formed orally depends on whether the detailed terms and conditions of the employment have been discussed and orally agreed upon between the parties.\n\n \n\nIf you have already accepted the new job offer by email, the answer will be the same unless the offer contains a clause that acceptance by email is not allowed.  \n\n \n\nThere are many possible scenarios and we cannot give an exhaustive answer here. For details, please refer to the section on [termination of employment and the relevant payments](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/employmentDisputes/mattersRelatedToEmploymentOrdinance/terminationOfEmploymentAndTheRelevantPayments/).

Deductions for absence from work. The sum to be deducted should be proportionate to the period of time that the employee is absent from work.\n2.

The total sum to be deducted must not exceed one quarter of the wages payable to the employee in that wage period.\n4. Deductions of the value of food and accommodation the employer supplies to the employee.\n5. Deductions, at the written request of the employee, in respect of contributions to be paid by the employee through the employer for any medical scheme, superannuation scheme, retirement scheme or thrift scheme.\n6.

        "answer": "You can try to recover part of your salary or to get a certain amount of compensation in the following ways.\n\n \n\n**i) Bankruptcy or Winding-up proceedings**\n\n \n\nIf an employee is owed wages, wages in lieu of notice, severance payment or other contractual sums by the employer, then the employee can (as a creditor) apply to the Court for a bankruptcy order (if the insolvent employer is not a limited company) or a winding-up order (if the insolvent employer is a limited company).\n\n \n\nUpon the making of a bankruptcy order or a winding-up order by the Court, the trustee or the provisional liquidator (who is normally the Official Receiver) takes immediate steps to recover and preserve the employer's assets. Those assets are normally sold by the trustee or liquidator, and the proceeds of sale, after the deduction of necessary expenses, are used to pay debts owed to the employer's creditors. If you want to know more about bankruptcy or winding-up proceedings, please go to the topic [Bankruptcy and Winding-up](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/bankruptcy_IndividualVoluntaryArrangement_Companies_Winding_up/).\n\n \n\nIf you have successfully obtained a bankruptcy order or winding-up order from the Court, then you are entitled to receive payment out of your employer's assets in preference (with priority) to most other creditors of your employer in respect of wages, wages in lieu of notice and severance payments under the statutory limit. In the preference debts, you can recover wages up to a maximum of $8,000. You can also recover wages in lieu of notice (not exceeding one month's wages or $2,000 whichever is the lesser) and severance payments not exceeding $8,000.\n\n \n\nHowever, any arrears of wages, wages in lieu of notice or severance payments that exceed the statutory limit are non-preferential debts, and the employee is treated as an ordinary creditor on claiming that exceeded amount.\n\n \n\nIn view of the time limit for wages to qualify for preferential payment in bankruptcy or winding-up proceedings, you should not delay taking legal action by relying on any mere promises by your employer or by some third party to pay your arrears of wages at a future date. This may result in the loss of entitlement to receive payment as a preferential creditor if the promises to pay are not kept.\n\n \n\nFor more information regarding employer insolvency, please see the [Labour Department's webpage](http://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/erb/content4.htm).\n\n \n\n**ii) Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund**\n\n \n\nDuring the bankruptcy or winding-up proceedings against your employer, you can also apply for ex-gratia payment from the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund (\"the Fund\"). The Fund is administered by the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund Board, and covers:\n\n- arrears of wages (during the four months before the last day of the employee's service) with a maximum amount of $36,000;\n- wages in lieu of notice (up to the equivalent of one month's wages) with the maximum amount of $22,500; and\n- severance payment with the maximum amount of $50,000 plus 50% of any excess entitlement.\n\n \n\nThe Commissioner for Labour will NOT approve any application for these payments for:\n\n- wages for service rendered more than 4 months before the last day of service;\n- wages for which the relevant application is made more than 6 months after the last day of service;\n- wages in lieu of notice or severance payment for which the relevant application is made more than 6 months after the date of termination of the employment contract.\n\nFor more information about the Fund, please see the [Labour Department's webpage](http://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/erb/content4.htm).",

        "answer": "If a person backs out of an accepted job offer before the commencement date, he or she is not an “employee” at that time and there is no way he or she can give any “notice”.

The employment contract is drafted in the manner that a reasonable person would have understood that the provision on the notice period or payment in lieu of notice would come into effect immediately upon acceptance of the offer; and\n\nb. the obligation to pay in lieu of the notice is a primary obligation where the provision provides a mechanism for termination of the contract, such that the employer may claim against the employee for the amount as a contractual debt as opposed to a remedy for breach of contract. The term “primary obligation” refers to the contractual provision that expressly provides a mechanism for termination of the contract.\n\n \n\nIn the following case, the Court of Appeal held that the particular contract in question has the above effect: *[Law Ting Pong Secondary School v.

Hence, other than commission which is gratuitous or payable only at the discretion of the employer, commission is wages and must be paid in accordance with the provisions of the Employment Ordinance. Subject to the provisions of other legislation, employers and employees may agree on how commission is calculated and payable in their employment contracts.\n\n \n\nAccording to [Section 6(5)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/608/s6.html) of the [Minimum Wage Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/608/), any commission paid:\n\n \n\n- with the prior agreement of the employee\n- at any time after the first 7 days of a wage period but before the end of the 7th day immediately after that wage period **must be counted** as part of the wages payable in respect of that wage period irrespective of when the work is done or the commission is otherwise payable under the contract of employment.\n\nHence, in determining whether the wages of an employee meet the minimum wage requirement, if there is prior agreement of the employee, commission can be counted as part of the wages payable in respect of a wage period according to the timing when the commission is paid. Without the prior agreement of the employee, the above provision is not applicable.\n\n \n\n**Example 1:**\n\n \n\nAn employee is entitled to a basic salary plus commission **according to the contract of employment**. His wage period is each calendar month. According to the contract of employment, commission is payable in respect of a number of wage periods.\n\n \n\n- → In determining whether the wages of this employee meet the minimum wage requirement, wages payable in respect of each month include the basic salary as well as the commission payable in respect of the corresponding month, no matter whether the employer has paid it or not.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n \n\nAn employer pays an employee commission of $1,000 (which is originally payable in respect of the wage period of March) on 31 January with the **prior agreement** of the employee.\n\n \n\n- → In determining whether the wages of this employee meet the minimum wage requirement, this commission of $1,000 is counted as wages payable in respect of January, not as wages payable in respect of March.\n\n   \n\n  Being paid in the period from 8 January to 7 February, the commission is counted as wages payable in respect of January.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n \n\nAn employer pays an employee commission of $2,000 and $3,000 on 8 April and 7 June respectively with the **prior agreement** of the employee. The commission is originally payable in respect of the wage period of July.\n\n \n\n- → In determining whether the wages of this employee meet the minimum wage requirement, the commission of $2,000 is counted as wages payable in respect of April and the commission of $3,000 is counted as wages payable in respect of May, both not being counted as wages payable in respect of July.\n\n   \n\n  Being paid in the period from 8 April to 7 May, the commission of $2000 is counted as wages payable in respect of April.\n\n   \n\n  Being paid in the period from 8 May to 7 June, the commission of $3000 is counted as wages payable in respect of May.",

Tsang Ching Fei v Mo King Guo (02/04/2008, DCPI2136/2006): failure to provide a pair of construction site safety boots has led the claimant to suffer a more serious injury to his left big toe than he otherwise would.\n2. Thapa Goma v Tina Global (HK) Limited and Another [2019] HKCFI 471: failure to provide training to adopt proper postures/methods for lifting heavy objects was held to be a breach of the employer’s duty in providing a safe system of work.\n\n \n\nThe above 2 cases are only parts of the examples of non-compliance by employers.

        "answer": "Although differential treatment in the workplace can be regarded as discrimination, there can be genuine needs for the employers to apply differential treatment to local and overseas employees. For example, the provision of housing benefits to overseas employees can be justified as they are in genuine need for a place to stay in order to work for the employers.\n\n \n\nIn fact, [section 14](https://hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/602/s14) of [Race Discrimination Ordinance](https://hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/602) has made it clear that the discrimination provisions do not apply to any differential treatment between local and overseas employees in an employment relationship specified in [Schedule 2](https://hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/602/sch2), which includes the following:\n\n \n\n1. Employees employed before 10 July 2009 who continued to be employed without a break in service;\n2. Certain judicial officers, ICAC officers or public officers; and\n3.

        "question": "AS AN EMPLOYEE, AM I ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION FOR WORK-RELATED STRESS?",
        "answer": "Due to long working hours and stressful working environment, it is not uncommon for an employee to develop work-related stress during the courses of employment. Questions often arise as to whether an employee is entitled to compensation for such stress and any subsequent mental illnesses that may develop as a result. \n\n \n\nUnder statute, [section 5](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/282/s5) of the [Employees’ Compensation Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/282) made it clear that “if in any employment, personal injury **by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment** is caused to an employee, his employer shall be liable to pay compensation in accordance with this Ordinance”. Therefore, employees should bear in mind that the ECO only applies to injuries caused by accident and does not cover psychiatric/mental illnesses due to a process of work. For instance, in the case *Wong Chick v Swire Pacific Ltd*, the employee who suffered from loss of hearing was unable to recover compensation under the ECO as it was caused by repeated and prolonged exposure to hazardous noise levels as opposed to an accident. Hence, psychiatric illnesses developed by accumulation of work-related stress are not covered by the Ordinance unless it can be proved that they have been caused as a result of an accident. Further, mental illnesses at present do not fall within the scope of “occupational diseases” under [Second ](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/282/sch2)[Schedule ](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/282/sch2)[2](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/282/sch2) of the ECO. \n\n \n\nHowever, an employee may claim against his employer for such loss and damage suffered under the common law. As we will look at in the later sections, an employer has an implied duty to provide a safe system of work and working environment to his employees which includes the duty to maintain a work environment that is safe and without risk to the employees’ health. The breach of such a duty can make the employer potentially liable for the mental illnesses suffered by the employees.",

        "question": "WHAT ARE THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS IF THERE IS A BREAK IN THE CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT?",
        "answer": "Employees in continuous employment enjoy more statutory benefits than those not in continuous employment under the [Employment Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/57). See: \"[What is a 'continuous' contract of employment?](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/employmentDisputes/mattersRelatedToEmploymentOrdinance/aBriefExplanationForAContractOfEmployment/q2)\".\n\n \n\nAs a general rule, if there is a break in continuous employment, the contract before the break and the new one after it will generally be treated as two separate contracts. Employees will not enjoy statutory benefits such as rest days, statutory holidays with pay, annual leave with pay, sickness allowance, severance payment and long service payment during the second contract until they have accumulated the required number of hours work again in the second contract under the \"418 requirements\".\n\n \n\nThere is an exception to the above general rule. If employees are still in continuous employment, they will be entitled to the statutory protection offered to those under continuous employment, such as severance payment, long service payment and so on. On the other hand, if they are not in continuous employment, they will not be entitled to them.

        "answer": "To implement wage reductions, an employer must obtain the consent of the employees in advance. Unilaterally reducing wages without the employee’s agreement will contravene the law with respect to timely payment of wages. If wages are not paid within one month after they become due, the employees may deem their contracts of employment to be terminated by their employer without notice and they will be entitled to payment in lieu of notice in addition to other statutory and contractual termination payment.\n\n \n\nIf employers must arrange no-pay leave for their employees due to special needs of the business, they will possibly be liable for severance payment to eligible employees. An employee will be taken to be laid off if the total number of days on which no work is provided, and no wages is paid exceeds half of the total number of normal working days in any four 4 consecutive weeks or one-third of the total number of normal working days in any 26 consecutive weeks. An employee with not less than 24 months of employment under a continuous contract is eligible for severance payment when being laid off.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, an employee employed under a continuous contract may claim for remedies under sections [32L](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/57/s32L) to [32Q](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/57/s32Q) of the [Employment Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/57) against an employer if the contract terms are varied without the employee’s consent, the employment contract does not expressly allow such a variation and the contract terms are varied without one of the five valid reasons as specified in [section 32K](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/57/s32K) of the [Employment Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/57).\n\n \n\nAs to the five valid reasons in [section 32K](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/57/s32K) of the [Employment Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/57), see: “[Unreasonable Variation of Employment](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/employmentDisputes/mattersRelatedToEmploymentOrdinance/terminationOfEmploymentAndTheRelevantPayments/unreasonable_variation_of_employment)”.\n\n \n\nThe remedies for unreasonable variation of the terms of the employment contract include an order for reinstatement or re-engagement, an award of terminal payments and an award of compensation; for detail, see: “[If I (as an employee) am facing unreasonable dismissal or unreasonable variation of the terms of my employment contract, then what can I do to protect my rights?](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/employmentDisputes/mattersRelatedToEmploymentOrdinance/terminationOfEmploymentAndTheRelevantPayments/q6)”.",

        "answer": "An employer is prohibited from dismissing a pregnant employee from the date on which she is confirmed pregnant by a medical certificate to the date on which she is due to return to work upon the expiry of her maternity leave if:\n\n \n\n- the employee has been employed under a [continuous contract](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/employmentDisputes/mattersRelatedToEmploymentOrdinance/aBriefExplanationForAContractOfEmployment/q2), and\n- she has served a notice of pregnancy to her employer.\n\n \n\nIf a pregnant employee is dismissed by her employer before she has served a notice of pregnancy, then she may serve such notice immediately after being informed of her dismissal. Under such circumstances, her employer must withdraw the dismissal or the notice of dismissal.\n\n \n\nHowever, employers are not prohibited from dismissing pregnant employees under the following circumstances:\n\n \n\n- the employee is summarily dismissed due to serious misconduct; or\n- where it has been expressly agreed that the employment is on probation, the employee is dismissed for reasons other than pregnancy during the probation period of not more than 12 weeks.\n\nThe judgment from the Court of Final Appeal in the case of [Hong Kong Ming Wah Shipping Company Ltd v Sun Min ](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2006/21.html)also mentioned that a pregnant employee has the right to remain in her employment and, subject to certain conditions, to receive the prescribed payments during the period of protection. The judgment further explained that there is no basis for cutting down this protection by pointing to an offer of an alternative employment under a new contract with some other entity (company/business organisation), albeit an entity which is a member of the same group of companies.\n\n \n\n**Offences and Penalties**\n\n \n\nExcept for the circumstances provided above, it is an offence for employers to dismiss pregnant employees. Employers who do so are liable to prosecution and, on conviction, to a fine of $100,000. Employers are also required to pay the following sums of money to the dismissed employee within 7 days after the day of termination:\n\n \n\n- wages in lieu of notice;\n- a further sum equivalent to one month's wages; and\n- 14 weeks' maternity leave pay if, but for the dismissal, she would have been entitled to such a payment.\n\n \n\nYou can also claim remedies/compensations against your employer if you were dismissed other than for a valid reason as specified in the [Employment ](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/57/)[Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/57) (please refer to the Q&A for [\"Unreasonable and unlawful termination\"](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/employmentDisputes/mattersRelatedToEmploymentOrdinance/terminationOfEmploymentAndTheRelevantPayments/unlawful_termination) ).",

WHEN THE DONOR IS EVENTUALLY DIAGNOSED TO BE MENTALLY INCAPABLE, THE ATTORNEY STILL DOES NOT LODGE THE ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY WITH THE COURT FOR REGISTRATION. CAN THE ATTORNEY EXERCISE HIS/HER POWERS UNDER THE ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY? AFTER ALL, THE ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY STIPULATES THAT IT WILL TAKE EFFECT UPON THE DONOR BEING DIAGNOSED TO BE SUFFERING FROM DEMENTIA.

        "answer": "No. Let’s imagine this scenario: the attorney brings the unregistered EPA to a bank and tries to withdraw money from the donor’s bank account (on the assumption that this power is listed in the EPA). He/She also brings along a medical certificate confirming that the donor is suffering from dementia. The attorney tells the bank clerk: “Hey, take a look at this EPA; the donor signed it; the doctor signed it; and the lawyer signed it. I also have this medical certificate. So now give me the money.” Will the bank clerk gladly comply? Probably not: [Section 4(3)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/501/s4.html)of the [*Enduring Powers of Attorney Ordinance*](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/501/) ([Cap.501](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/501/) of the Laws of Hong Kong) states: “*In the event of the subsequent mental incapacity of the donor, the attorney shall not do anything under the authority of the power unless or until it is registered.*” The bank clerk probably would not comply with the attorney’s request based on an unregistered EPA.

SO I CAN JUST WRITE A FEW WORDS MAKING THE APPOINTMENT, SIGN IT, AND PERHAPS GET A FRIEND TO WITNESS MY SIGNATURE. THEN THAT’S ALL THERE IS TO IT, RIGHT?",
        "answer": "No. Under the present law, an Enduring Power of Attorney must be in the prescribed form, which means the Form(s) set out in the [Schedules](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/501A/sch.html) to the [*Enduring Powers of Attorney (Prescribed Form) Regulation*](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/501A/) ([Cap.501A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/501A/) of the Laws of Hong Kong). There are also specific requirements as to who can or cannot be the witness of your and the attorney’s signatures on an Enduring Power of Attorney. It is therefore suggested that you seek legal advice if you are serious about making an Enduring Power of Attorney.",

        "answer": "An Enduring Power of Attorney cannot guarantee that the attorney will always be a trustworthy person. But the existing law provides that a donor can impose restriction on the attorney’s power by stating those restrictions in the Enduring Power of Attorney. It also allows the donor to nominate person(s) to be notified by the attorney applying for registration of the Enduring Power of Attorney. Further, an “*interested party*” is entitled to raise queries on an attorney’s behaviour and even ask the Court to remove the attorney. Therefore, you can restrict or limit your attorney’s power in the Enduring Power of Attorney. You can also explicitly spell out the name(s) of the person(s) whom your attorney must notify before applying for the registration of the Power of Attorney, so that the notified person(s) can assist in monitoring your attorney’s acts when you have become mentally incapacitated.",

        "question": "MORE THAN ONE ATTORNEY?",
        "answer": "The only difference between the 2 prescribed forms of EPA is: Form 1 is to be used when the donor intends to appoint only one attorney, and Form 2 is to be used when the donor intends to appoint more than one attorney. Before a donor starts filling in the right form, he/she therefore has to decide whether one or more attorney is required. \n\n \n\nHaving a sole attorney will render the attorney able to react to different circumstances and make decision in a prompt manner. In the case of multple attorneys, even if they are to act[ jointly and severally](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/enduring_Powers_of_Attorney/The_essence_of_an_EPA_and_what_it_can_achieve/More_than_one_attorney/Jointly_and_severally), one attorney may hesitate to exercise his/her power solely, lest he/she be accused of abuse of power if a dispute arises later among the attorneys. However, this may exactly be the reason why more than one attorney is needed: they will monitor and restrain each other so as to minimize the chance of any one attorney abusing his/her authority.\n\n \n\nPlease note that the donor must choose whether his/her attorneys are to act [jointly](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/enduring_Powers_of_Attorney/The_essence_of_an_EPA_and_what_it_can_achieve/More_than_one_attorney/Jointly/) or[ jointly and severally](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/enduring_Powers_of_Attorney/The_essence_of_an_EPA_and_what_it_can_achieve/More_than_one_attorney/Jointly_and_severally/), and delete the inappropriate option set out in the prescribed form.

It is possible that the attorney will never be able to get hold of the EPA and thus will not be able to assist in managing the donor’s financial affairs although he/she is supposed to do so.\n\n \n\nIt appears appropriate that even if the donor wants to keep the EPA in his/her own custody, he/she should at least let the attorney know where to find the EPA in case of the donor’s mental incapacity.",

The attorney will also be the person responsible for exercising the authority as specified in the EPA. It seems that the attorney appears to be the appropriate person for keeping custody of the EPA.\n\n \n\nDespite the above ideal scenario, we have to face the sad reality that people can change; after the execution of the EPA, the attorney may change to an extent that the donor loses all trust and confidence in the attorney. In such circumstances, if the donor wants to get back the EPA, the attorney may refuse to do so. The donor will then have to resort to revoking the EPA and perhaps having to make a new one by appointing another attorney. Therefore, a donor should act promptly to revoke an EPA if it is in the custody of an attorney whom the donor no longer trusts.",

        "question": "WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF A PERSON FAILS TO EXECUTE AN ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY BEFORE HE/SHE BECOMES MENTALLY INCAPACITATED?",
        "answer": "Statistical figures indicate that the EPA is far from being a tool commonly used by Hong Kong citizens. Enough has been said here about the advantages of an EPA. Let’s take a look at a hypothetical case where the protagonist fails to execute an EPA before he becomes mentally incapacitated.\n\n \n\n**Hypothetical case: Mr. X**\n\n \n\nMr. X, who was 60 years old and financial relatively well-off, began to show signs of memory loss, decreased ability to think, language impairment, inability to recognize relatives, and other indicative signs of dementia. Mrs. X heard about the concept of an EPA and thought that it was a good idea to get Mr. X sign an EPA. She promptly got a solicitor to advise her on the feasibility of making an EPA for Mr. X. The solicitor told her that since Mr. X already showed signs of dementia, it was perhaps too late to try to do an EPA because Mr. X had to do it while he was still mentally sound. The solicitor then recommended Mr. and Mrs. X to consult a medical doctor as soon as possible to ascertain Mr. X’s mental status. Mrs. X brought Mr. X to consult a few medical practitioners; and all of them diagnosed Mr. X as suffering from dementia and was no longer mentally capable. Naturally, none of these medical practitioners are prepared to certify on an EPA that Mr. X is mentally capable. Now apart from taking care of Mr. X’s physical well-being, the X family has to face the following financial problems:\n\n \n\n- While the family appears relatively well-off, most of the family assets, including cash in banks and shares in publicly listed companies are held in Mr. X’s sole name.\n- Therefore, Mrs. X is not able to touch or liquidate those assets to cater for the family’s fiscal expenses and Mr. X’s medical expenses.\n- Mr. and Mrs. X have a joint account at a bank, with a balance of several hundred thousand dollars. Mrs. X will be able to withdraw money from this account. But it is expected that the money in this account will be depleted within a few years (or maybe within an even shorter period).\n- Mrs. X will now have to rely on her own savings to support the family.\n- Mrs. X will also have to sell some of her jewellery to get some cash. Luckily most of her jewellery is kept in a safe deposit box in her own name.\n- Mrs. X understands that Mr. X has kept some rare coins which would worth some money. Those coins were kept in a safe deposit box in Mr. X’s sole name. So again Mrs. X cannot access them. \n- The most disturbing matter is their son. Mr. and Mrs. X have a son, who unfortunately is a spendthrift and has never had a proper job even though he is already 40 years old. The relationship between the parents and the son is of course bitter. However, since this is their only son, Mr. and Mrs. X still love him and have tolerated him and financially supported him for years. Now Mrs. X is very worried that their son will take advantage of Mr. X’s mental condition by, for instance, taking Mr. X to the bank to withdraw a large sum of money and get the money for himself.\n\nEvidently, none of the above disastrous events would happen if Mr. X had made an EPA while he was still mentally capable.",

        "question": "WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE DONOR OF AN ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY EVENTUALLY BECOMES MENTALLY INCAPACITATED?",
        "answer": "Let’s take a look at Ms. Y’s case.\n\n \n\n**Hypothetical case: Ms. Y**\n\n \n\nMs. Y made her EPA when she was still mentally capable. Ms. Y’s husband passed away years ago and left her with a reasonably generous estate. She had 2 sons. The elder one, unfortunately, was a prodigal who had left the family years ago. He broke Ms. Y’s heart so much that she did not consider this man her son anymore. Fortunately Ms. Y’s second son was a man with filial piety; he lived with and took care of Ms. Y who was approaching 70 years old. The second son was also the attorney under the EPA. The EPA expressly specifies that it would take effect when Ms. Y was diagnosed to be mentally incapable. The EPA also contained sufficiently clear and specific instructions as to how the second son should handle Ms. Y’s property and financial affairs. It also empowered the second son to transfer Ms. Y’s money to his bank accounts set up for the sole purpose of accommodating and administering Ms. Y’s assets. Recently the second son noticed that Ms. Y was showing some obvious signs of dementia. This sad fact was verified by the family’s doctor. The second son took the EPA to his solicitor and sought legal advice. Then: \n\n \n\n- The solicitor assisted the second son by taking the EPA to the Court for registration.\n- The second son was a righteous man but was not doing very good in his career. His income barely supported himself and could not maintain Ms. Y’s living standard. Fortunately, pursuant to [section 4(5)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/501/s4.html) of the*[ Enduring Powers of Attorney Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/501/)* ([Cap.501](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/501/) of the Laws of Hong Kong), the second son was able to access Ms. Y’s assets to a certain extent while waiting for the registration of the EPA.\n- Upon the completion of the registration process, the second son was able to gain full access to Ms. Y’s assets. With the assistance of the EPA, he was able to use Ms. Y’s financial resources to take good care of her.\n- Then the elder son appeared after years of disappearance. He asked the second son to give him his “share” in their parents’ fortune. The second son of course refused.\n- The elder son tried to approach Ms. Y and take advantage of her mental incapacity. Fortunately, as empowered by the EPA, the second son had set up a fresh bank account in his own name, where this bank account was used solely to take up Ms. Y’s money. The second son was also wise enough to have withdrawn all money from Ms. Y’s bank account and transferred the money into this fresh bank account in his name.\n- Even if the elder son took Ms. Y to a bank and tried to withdraw money, there was no money in Ms. Y’s account at all.\n- The second son continued to take good care of Ms. Y.\n\nBy comparing Ms. Y’s case with Mr. X’s, one would easily note that the difference is sufficiently evident to necessitate any further explanation. While the word “fortunately” is used a number of times in the above hypothetical case of Ms. Y, it is not fortune which brings forth such a difference. It is Ms. Y’s good preparation for the future; and the key is the EPA.",

        "question": "APART FROM GOING TO COURT TO APPLY FOR A DIVORCE, ARE THERE ANY OTHER CHANNELS THROUGH WHICH UNHAPPY SPOUSES CAN SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES? WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE OTHER CHANNELS AND DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS?",
        "answer": "You may consider making use of the following alternatives:-\n\n \n\n**(i) Deed of Separation** – It refers to a separation agreement that can be made between the two parties by themselves. The agreement can specify a period of separation, and what the parties will do with their children (if any) and how their children’s and each other’s maintenance will be provided. It is recommended that a lawyer be consulted before such an agreement is made.\n\n \n\nA deed of separation is appropriate where the parties are in a harmonious relationship and there is a good chance that each party will agree to be bound by the terms.\n\n \n\nBut the downsides of this option are:\n\n \n\n- If any party has breached the term(s) of the Deed, the other party can only sue the breaching party for breach of contract. The enforcement of it is different from the enforcement of a court order made in divorce or judicial separation proceedings.\n- Legal Aid is not available for negotiating a deed of separation.\n- In situations where proceedings for divorce or judicial separation are issued subsequently, the existence of a deed of separation does not prevent the Court from making a different order even though the deed embodies terms to the effect that the parties intended it to be final: ***because the law provides that any term in a deed that restricts the right of any party to apply to the Court in future proceedings shall be void***. But in future proceedings the Court will usually be inclined to uphold the terms of the deed (assuming it was made voluntarily and each party had the opportunity to seek independent legal advice) unless there is very good reason to do otherwise.\n\n**(ii) Separation Order** – Under some circumstances, and if no agreement can be reached, one party can apply to the District Court for a separation order together with maintenance orders (e.g. Either party may be ordered by the Court to give financial support to the other party, and/or the children, for the costs of living.) provided that he or she has not committed adultery. In the case of a wife, she may apply where the husband has been convicted of having assaulted her, or has deserted her, or is guilty of persistent cruelty to her, or her infant children, or has knowingly transmitted venereal disease to her, or has compelled her to be a prostitute, or is a habitual drunkard or drug addict. In the case of a husband, he may apply where the wife has been guilty of persistent cruelty to his children or is a habitual drunkard or drug addict.\n\n \n\nIf the Court finds that there are sufficient grounds, it may order that the parties be separated, ***i.e. they need not live together any more although they are still legally husband and wife (they are not free to re-marry at this stage)***. The Court may also make orders relating to the custody of the children and the maintenance of the other spouse and of the children.\n\n \n\n**(iii) Judicial Separation** – A spouse or couple may apply to the District Court for a judicial separation, which is a legal process through which parties obtain formal recognition of their separation. The minimum [1 year rule of marriage](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/familyMatrimonialAndCohabitation/divorce/precondition/q2) does not apply to judicial separation. However, to get a judicial separation, the applicant has to prove basically the same facts as they would in a divorce.[see [Part IV on Divorce](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/familyMatrimonialAndCohabitation/divorce)] The effect of a judicial separation is the same as a separation order, i.e. the parties are still husband and wife but they need not cohabit. ***Parties who are judicially separated are not free to re-marry***. The Decree is only granted subject to the requirement that satisfactory arrangements have been made for the welfare of any children.\n\n \n\nThere are several possible reasons why a couple would apply for judicial separation instead of divorce, for example:\n\n \n\n- when one or both parties are opposed to divorce on either religious or moral grounds;\n- one party does not wish to give the other the ability to remarry;\n- when the parties have been married for less than 1 year and are therefore unable to apply for divorce;\n- in order to prevent the loss of benefits available only to a spouse.\n\nThe existence of a judicial separation decree does not preclude either party from applying for divorce subsequently.\n\n \n\n**(iv) Mediation** – Family mediation is an alternative way to settle family dispute other than going to Court. It has been increasingly used by separating or divorcing couples to settle issues arising from marriage breakdown.\n\n \n\nWhat is \"family mediation\"?\n\n \n\nIn practical terms, family mediation is a problem-solving process designed to help separating/divorcing couples reach their own mutually acceptable agreements regarding on-going arrangements for their children and/or the resolution of financial matters.\n\n \n\nIt is a voluntary process in which a trained, impartial third person (the mediator) can assist both parties to communicate and negotiate issues in a confidential setting.\n\n \n\nIn a family mediation session, the mediator will help you to:\n\n \n\n- discuss and decide which areas are in dispute;\n- explore each party's needs and interests;\n- expand options and select the most suitable solution;\n- draw up your agreement in detail setting out how you have agreed to solve each problem.\n\nMediators? Who are they?\n\n \n\nMediators come from various professional backgrounds. They usually have qualifications in law, psychology, social work or social science. They are specially trained and have to meet accreditation requirements covering knowledge and skills in negotiation and dispute resolution. They are also required to abide by a Code of Practice.\n\n \n\nMediators are neutral. They\n\n \n\n- do not take sides with either party;\n- do not make decisions for parties;\n- do not provide legal advice. Parties will be encouraged to consult their own lawyers for legal advice.\n- do not offer counselling or therapy but may suggest such services;\n- suggest new avenues to explore;\n- help parties assess their own case realistically, assess the feasibility of the decisions; and\n- help parties to explore settlement proposals in depth and find the solutions.",

        "answer": "You should note the following items (a) to (c) before presenting a divorce petition to the Court.\n\n \n\n**a. Place of marriage**\n\n \n\nThe place of marriage is not of main concern. Provided that your marriage was validly constituted in the country where the marriage was celebrated, and the validity of your marriage can be proved, then subject to the following factors, you can apply for divorce in the Court of Hong Kong.\n\n \n\n**b. Conditions to comply with**\n\n \n\nOne of the following conditions must be satisfied before an application or petition for divorce can be dealt with by a Hong Kong Court:\n\n \n\n1. either of the parties to the marriage was [domiciled in Hong Kong](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary) on the date of the petition or application;\n2. either of the parties to the marriage was habitually resident in Hong Kong throughout a period of 3 years immediately preceding the date of the petition or application; or\n3. either of the parties to the marriage had a “substantial connection” with Hong Kong on the date of the petition or application.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that whether a “substantial connection” exists will depend on all the circumstances of each case, including but not limited to, the length of time the parties have lived in Hong Kong prior to their application for divorce, how long they intend to stay in Hong Kong, whether the parties have employment in Hong Kong, and whether they have acquired assets or taken a lease of property in the territory.\n\n \n\n**c. Length of marriage － the “one year rule”**\n\n \n\nIn general, subject to the following exceptions, no petition for divorce could be presented to a Hong Kong Court before the expiration of the period of 1 year from the date of the marriage ( [section 12](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/179/s12.html) of the [Matrimonial Causes Ordinance ](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/179/), [Cap. 179](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/179/) ).\n\n \n\nThere are 2 possible exceptions to this **“one year rule”**:\n\n \n\n- exceptional hardship being suffered by the petitioner (“petitioner” being the applicant or the party presenting the petition for divorce); or\n- exceptional depravity on the part of the respondent (“respondent” being the applicant's spouse / petitioner's spouse).\n\nHowever, in determining the application for divorce before the expiration of the period of 1 year from the date of the marriage, the Court shall have regard to the interests of any child of the family within the meaning of [section 2](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/192/s2.html) of the [Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/192/), [Cap. 192](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/192/) (which can also include a child who is not the natural child of one of the parties to the marriage) and to the question whether there is reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties during the remaining period before one year has expired.",

        "question": "SHALL I CHOOSE TO APPLY FOR DIVORCE IN HONG KONG?",
        "answer": "**a. Alternative option**\n\n \n\nGiven the fact that Hong Kong is an international financial centre, it is common in Hong Kong for either or both parties to a marriage to have a close connection with another country, this is particularly so among the expatriates.\n\n \n\nIt is important to consider from a pragmatic perspective whether or not Hong Kong is the best place to initiate the divorce proceedings. The following factors are of relevance:\n\n \n\n- How each country under consideration deals with divorce, the custody of children, and the financial matters － there may be vast significant differences, particularly over financial matters.\n- For instance, in the US and Canada, they have ‘community property’ laws, so that “marital property” (i.e. property acquired during the marriage) is divided equally on divorce.\n- One cannot obtain a divorce in Australia or New Zealand until you have been separated for a year. New Zealand courts approach the division of capital assets in a similar way as in the States and Canada and do not place as much emphasis on maintenance rights as the courts in Hong Kong do.\n- Also, although the systems of divorce in Hong Kong and in England and Wales are very similar, they are not identical.\n- It is important to have regard to the ease of enforcement of any court orders obtained against his or her spouse. For example, if your spouse refused to pay alimony, what action can be done against his or her assets? (It is usually convenient and most beneficial to charge or freeze against his or her assets when the court orders are made in the country in which the non-complying spouse lives and/or the main family assets are situated).\n- It is usually more convenient to initiate the divorce proceedings in the country in which you reside because of the easier access to your lawyers and attendance in court if necessary.\n\nIf either or both parties to the marriage have substantial or close connections with one or more alternative countries or if your spouse is intending to institute proceedings in one country when it occurred to you that the legal system of another country might be available and of greater benefit to you, then you should seek legal advice from a matrimonial lawyer in each country before starting any divorce proceedings in order to make an informed decision. This has to be done without delay, failing which time (which is closely related with costs) would be wasted.\n\n \n\nIf both parties commence divorce proceedings in different countries, it is likely that it would give rise to a costly dispute over which country is the most appropriate place or forum for dealing with the divorce. The parties may even compete to obtain the first divorce decree, since the forum or the country in which the first decree is made will then be empowered to deal with the important ancillary matters of children and finance.\n\n \n\n**b. Recognition of Hong Kong divorce decrees**\n\n \n\nFor the sake of saving unnecessary costs, before you start the divorce proceedings, it is vital to check for the recognition of the divorce decree that you intend to obtain, that is, whether it would be recognized by the Hong Kong Court, or whether the Hong Kong divorce decree is recognized by other countries.\n\n \n\nAlthough the divorce decree granted by Hong Kong Court is recognized in many countries, it is not recognized in all places. In this regard, you should consult your lawyers.",

        "question": "OTHER THAN THE MARRIAGES REGISTERED UNDER THE MARRIAGE ORDINANCE IN HONG KONG, WHAT OTHER TYPES OF MARRIAGES ARE RECOGNIZED BY HONG KONG LAW? CAN A COUPLE WHOSE MARRIAGE IS REGISTERED IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, OR A COUPLE MARRIED THROUGH TRADITIONAL CHINESE CUSTOMS, OR A NON-REGISTERED COUPLE APPLY FOR DIVORCE IN HONG KONG?",
        "answer": "**Registered Marriage**\n\n \n\nSince 7th October,1971, a couple in Hong Kong can only validly marry in accordance with the [Marriage Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/181/) ([Cap. 181](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/181/) of The Laws of Hong Kong). This generally means that it must be a voluntary union for life of one man with one woman to the exclusion of all others and that the marriage ceremony must be carried out at one of the Marriage Registries or licensed places of worship. This is called a registered marriage.\n\n \n\n**Foreign Marriage**\n\n \n\nA foreign marriage celebrated outside Hong Kong in accordance with the law in force at the time and in the place where the marriage was performed is generally recognized as a valid marriage similar to a marriage registered in Hong Kong.\n\n \n\n**Chinese Customary Marriage and Modern Marriage**\n\n \n\nHowever, apart from registered marriages and foreign marriages, the law also recognizes as valid 2 other types of marriage if they were contracted in Hong Kong before 7th October, 1971.\n\n \n\n***- Chinese Customary Marriage\\***\n\n \n\nThe first type is Chinese customary marriage. It is a marriage celebrated in accordance with the traditional Chinese customs that were accepted at the time of the marriage, either in the part of Hong Kong where the marriage took place, or in the parties' family place of origin, usually their native place in China.\n\n \n\n***- Modern Marriage\\***\n\n \n\nThe other type is called a modern marriage, which is one where an unmarried man and a woman neither of which was less than 16 years of age went through an open ceremony in the presence of at least two witnesses in such a manner that a reasonable person would think that a marriage has been celebrated. \n\n \n\nFor this type of marriage, the kind of marriage ceremony performed did not have to be in accordance with formal Chinese law and custom, it would be valid and subsisting as long as a reasonable man thinks a marriage had taken place.\n\n \n\nIt is important to note that the ceremony had to be ‘open’ in the sense that it was so held that it was known and could be seen by all those who were not particularly invited to participate. This requirement would be satisfied by, for example, leaving the door of the room in which the ceremony took place open. This type of marriage is also called validated marriage.\n\n \n\nParties to these 2 latter types of marriage (Chinese customary marriage and modern marriage) can have them post-registered at the Marriage Registry. If one party refuses to post-register it, the other may apply to the District Court for a declaration that such a marriage exists and thereafter can post-register it unilaterally.\n\n \n\nParties to a ***registered marriage or a foreign marriage*** seeking a divorce must go through the Family Court of Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nTo obtain a divorce in a ***Chinese customary marriage*** situation, the party or parties must first of all have the marriage post-registered or declared valid by the District Court. If the parties agree to divorce, they must go before a designated public officer who will explain the consequences to them and ask them to sign an agreement. If only one party wants a divorce, he or she can apply to the court in the [usual way](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/familyMatrimonialAndCohabitation/divorce/proceduresAndGroundsForDivorce/) , but only after the registration or declaration of the marriage as stated above.\n\n \n\nIn the case of a ***modern marriage***, if both parties agree, they can divorce by going before a designated public officer and by signing a written document. The written document sets out unequivocally the final and complete dissolution of the marriage and must be signed in the presence of 2 witnesses.\n\n \n\nEither party to these 2 types of marriages can, upon divorce, apply for maintenance (financial support) if the need arises.",

        "answer": "**You are advised to consult a lawyer before submitting the relevant documents and attending hearings in the Family Court.**\n\n \n\nYou need to go through the following stages:-\n\n \n\n(Stage 1) Presenting a petition for divorce\n\n![img](https://clic.org.hk/themes/gavias_amon/images/downarrow.gif)\n\n(Stage 2) Serving (delivering) my petition to my spouse\n\n![img](https://clic.org.hk/themes/gavias_amon/images/downarrow.gif)\n\n(Stage 3) Fixing a court hearing date\n\n![img](https://clic.org.hk/themes/gavias_amon/images/downarrow.gif)\n\n(Stage 4) Decree Nisi – a tentative court order for divorce\n\n![img](https://clic.org.hk/themes/gavias_amon/images/downarrow.gif)\n\n(Stage 5) Final order for divorce\n\n**(Stage 1) Presenting a petition for divorce**\n\n \n\nTo start divorce proceedings, you need to fill in:\n\n \n\n| Form 2  | [Petition](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/fcf.html) (the form that you need to fill in depends on your particular circumstances or grounds for divorce) |\n| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Form 2B | [Statement as to the arrangements for children](https://www.judiciary.hk/doc/en/court_services_facilities/fc/form2b.pdf) (if applicable) |\n| Form E  | [Financial Statement for financial dispute](https://www.judiciary.hk/doc/en/court_services_facilities/fc/forme.pdf) (if applicable) |\n| Form 3  | Notice of Proceedings                                        |\n| Form 4  | Acknowledgement of Service (case number and name of parties only, other items to be completed by the respondent) |\n\nIn the case of a ***Joint Application*** (which means you and your spouse have agreed to apply together for a divorce), you need to fill in:\n\n \n\n| Form 2C | [Joint application](https://www.judiciary.hk/doc/en/court_services_facilities/fc/form2c.pdf) |\n| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Form 2D | [Statement as to the arrangements for children](https://www.judiciary.hk/doc/en/court_services_facilities/fc/form2d.pdf) (if applicable) |\n\nAll forms you need are available from the Family Court Registry and may be completed in English or Chinese. When you have filled them in, take them to the Family Court Registry for filing, together with your original marriage certificate or a certified true copy. The filing fee is $630. You will be given a case number, which must be marked on any subsequently filed documents.\n\n \n\n**(Stage 2) Serving (delivering) my petition to my spouse**\n\n \n\nNow that you have started legal proceedings, you are known as the \"petitioner\" and your spouse is known as the \"respondent\". After filing your petition, you must arrange for a sealed copy ( “sealed” meaning a copy with the court’s chop on it) of the petition to be served on every other party to the proceedings, either by hand or by post. Note that you must not serve the petition on the respondent yourself. Instead you must use the services of a third person, or send the petition by post. If the petition fails to reach the respondent by hand or by post, the petition can be advertised in newspapers (with the approval of the Court) as a substitute way to notify the respondent.\n\n \n\nIn the case a ***Joint Application***, there is no need to arrange for a sealed copy to be served on the other party.\n\n \n\n**(Stage 3) Fixing a court hearing date**\n\n \n\nAfter your petition has been served on the respondent you should next apply to the Registrar for directions to set down the case for trial (i.e. to fix a date for a court hearing), using an application form obtainable from the Family Court Registry. Your petition or application will be set down for hearing in one of the following lists on payment of the stated fee:\n\n \n\n- Special Procedure List: $630\n- Defended List: $1,045\n\nWhere a petition is concerned, before the case can be set down, the Registrar must be satisfied that the petition has been served on the respondent. This can be proved either by showing that the respondent has completed and returned a Form 4 (Acknowledgment of Service) to the Registrar, or by having the person who served the documents on the respondent file an affirmation confirming that the petition has been delivered to the respondent. Joint Applications will be set down provided that the relevant documents are in order.\n\n \n\nThe Registrar will make directions on the date, place and time of the trial and will notify you and the other parties.\n\n \n\n**(Stage 4) Decree Nisi – a tentative court order for divorce**\n\n \n\n \n\n***Special Procedure List***\n\n \n\nIf you have petitioned for divorce but the respondent does not file an answer in response to your petition, the petition will be set down in the Special Procedure List. Joint Applications also come under the Special Procedure List.\n\n \n\nAfter the Registrar has given directions for trial, he will consider the evidence you have filed. If he is satisfied that you have proved the contents of the petition or application, he will make and file a certificate to that effect. Both parties will receive a copy, endorsed with the terms they have agreed. There is no need for either party to attend the hearing. The Court will grant a **decree nisi** (a tentative court order) dissolving the marriage.\n\n \n\n \n\n***Defended List***\n\n \n\nWhere a petition for divorce is made and the respondent has filed an answer, the petition will be set down in the Defended List. In such cases, the Court will either grant a **decree nisi** dissolving the marriage, or will dismiss the petition if insufficient evidence is found. In the case of a petition listed on the Defended List, either or both of the parties may need to attend the court hearing.\n\n \n\nIn the event of court granting the decree of divorce, if the question of child custody and access arises, or if there are applications for ancillary relief by either party, the court will adjourn these matters to Chambers with directions for social investigations report and filing of affidavit of means by the parties where appropriate.\n\n \n\n**(Stage 5) Final order for divorce**\n\n \n\n6 weeks after the Court has granted a decree nisi, you can apply for your decree to be made absolute (a final order for divorce) by sending a completed \"Notice of Application for Decree Nisi to be made Absolute\" to the Court, using Form 5 (for a petition) or Form 5A (for a joint application).\n\n \n\nIf there are children of the marriage, the decree nisi will not be made absolute until the Court declares that it is satisfied with the arrangements made for them. The Registrar will issue a Certificate of Decree Absolute to each party if the registrar is satisfied that the statutory requirements have been complied with.\n\n \n\n(For more details of the above procedures, you may also visit the website of the Judiciary of Hong Kong on [“How to apply for a divorce”](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/divorce.html).)",

        "answer": "**Wardship**\n\n \n\nIf that is the case, you may consider instituting wardship proceedings in the High Court. Wardship proceedings can be instituted at any time when there are special concerns about a child's welfare such as when it is suspected that a child would be, or has been, removed from Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nOnce wardship proceedings have been instituted, the Court has very wide and far-reaching powers to make any order, including financial provision that is necessary to protect the interests and welfare of the ‘ward’ / the child.\n\n\nIn cases where a child has been taken out of Hong Kong, the Court can order that the child be sought and found, seeking the cooperation and assistance of other relevant authorities such as the Immigration Department.\n\n \n\n**Once a child is made as a ‘ward’, he or she is automatically prohibited from leaving Hong Kong without the consent of the Court.**\n\n \n\nWardship proceedings are an entirely different form of proceedings which can be issued irrespective of any divorce or separation proceedings. It can be started quite quickly by any interested party – which is not necessarily a parent.\n\n \n\nIf circumstances are justified, wardship proceedings could be commenced by the Director of Social Services, who is empowered to protect children.\n\n \n\nThe issuing of wardship proceedings immediately makes the child concerned a **Ward of the Court**.\n\n \n\nOnce a child becomes a “Ward of the Court”, this means that the Court has the custody of that child and every major decision regarding that child’s welfare must be referred to the Court by making application accordingly. This would incur costs and, subject to the caseloads of the Court, can be very time-consuming.\n\n \n\nThat child remains a ward of the court until the child reaches the age of majority, or until a special Court order is made to end the wardship.

However, this option is not absolutely secure as it may not prevent your spouse from obtaining a fresh or duplicate travel documents without your knowledge.\n\n \n\n**(3) Prohibition Order**\n\n \n\nIf the deposit of the relevant travel documents as security is not feasible or not secure enough, you can consider applying for a prohibition order, which can be made within the divorce or separation proceedings. This is an order prohibiting the removal of the child from Hong Kong or out of your custody, care and control.\n\n \n\nIf either wardship proceedings or prohibition order is involved, your acting solicitor should immediately notify the Immigration Department by serving it with the prohibition order or wardship proceedings.

        "answer": "It is not uncommon that divorced couple fears that the former spouse would take the child out of Hong Kong either permanently (e.g. for emigration) or for holiday without his or her advance notice, thereby depriving him or her of the opportunity of child's visiting access.\n\n \n\nIn view of this, custody orders are endorsed with a notice in the form of a direction that neither parent is entitled to remove the child from Hong Kong unless the following conditions are met:\n\n \n\n1. obtain the approval of the Court; OR\n2. obtain the written consent of the other parent who is not responsible for taking the child out of Hong Kong, AND the giving of a general undertaking by the parent (who will take the child out of Hong Kong) to the Court to return the child to Hong Kong after any fixed period spent abroad or at the end of any agreed period, or earlier if called upon to do so by the Court.\n\n**Holidays**\n\n \n\nDisputes often arose between divorced couple over the division of holidays in respect of child access. Costly application would have to be made to the Court to resolve the disputes if the parties failed to come up with an agreement.\n\n \n\nTo save cost, upon the making of a custody order with the aforesaid (a) or (b) restriction specified on it, it is possible to file with the Court a general undertaking to return the child after any holiday period spent abroad.\n\n \n\nThis means that when you want to take the child out of Hong Kong, all you need to do is to obtain your spouse's written consent.\n\n \n\nIt is only when your spouse unreasonably withheld his or her consent that an application will have to be made to the Court. In the case of a normal holiday, it is unlikely that the Court will refuse the application unless there is good reason to do so.\n\n \n\nIf you believe that your spouse would object to you taking your child to overseas for holidays, you should inform your solicitor well in advance so that there is ample time for your solicitor to make the necessary application to the Court and to have an early hearing.\n\n \n\n**Permanent removal from Hong Kong**\n\n \n\nIf a parent, who is granted with the custody of a child, intends to leave Hong Kong permanently for some reasons, that parent must make an application to Court so as to obtain an order from the Court allowing him or her to remove the child permanently from Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nIf the other parent opposes such application, the judge will have to balance the child's loss of regular contact with that parent against the liberty of the applicant parent (granted with custody) to choose where he or she wishes to live. The Court will not usually interfere with the choice of the parent with custody, if his or her decision to move is a reasonable one. As said, the Court would have regard to the interests of the child, which is of paramount consideration.",

If a child has already settled well with one of the parents and is used to and happy with his/her surroundings and lifestyle, the Court is unlikely to consider taking the child away from that parent unless there are other compelling reasons.\n\n \n\nTherefore you are unlikely to be granted custody of your daughter in this circumstance unless you can present other compelling reasons. However, you may have generous access to (i.e. to see) your child as approved by the Court.",

        "question": "HOW WOULD THE COURT DEAL WITH OR DIVIDE THE MATRIMONIAL PROPERTIES BETWEEN THE HUSBAND & WIFE UPON DIVORCE?",
        "answer": "There are some general principles regarding the division of properties between the parties upon divorce:\n\n \n\n**a. Ownership of property**\n\n \n\nDisputes about bank accounts can arise in respect of ownership of the funds and property purchased with the funds derived therein.\n\n \n\nIf a bank account is in a spouse's name, then it appears that any money in the account belongs to that person, unless there is a contrary intention or another spouse has made a contribution to the fund.\n\n \n\nIf a bank account is held in joint names, then it appears that any money in the account belongs to both parties jointly, unless there is a contrary intention, e.g. that the account was put into joint names for convenience.\n\n \n\nAs a general rule, any property acquired with the funds from a bank account belongs to the purchaser.\n\n \n\nThus, if a husband draws money from a joint account to purchase shares or real property in his sole name, then it appears that these properties belong to him. But if the parties have pooled their resources together, the Court may treat the joint account as a 'common pool' and held that investments purchased by the husband with money from the joint account belonged to both husband and wife in equal shares, albeit the husband had made larger contributions to the joint account than the wife.\n\n \n\n**b. A roof over each party's head**\n\n \n\nThe Court will ensure that, wherever possible, there is a roof over each party's head. This is in particular so when there are children in the family. The Court will ensure that the children are properly taken care of by providing them a secure home.\n\n \n\n**c. Percentage of the total capital available**\n\n \n\nHong Kong Court used to assess the 'reasonable requirements' of the spouses and divided the assets accordingly. Leftover assets have very often been awarded to the breadwinner, usually the husband.\n\n \n\nHowever, the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong had ruled in [LKW v DD (2010) 13 HKCFAR 537](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2010/70.html) that a wife is entitled to half of the couple's assets when they divorce in Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nThis 50/50 rule will have major impact in cases where the financial assets are substantial. As a consequence, pre- and post-nuptial agreements will be extremely important for those in Hong Kong who wish to protect his/her personal wealth.\n\n \n\n**d. Maintenance or \"Clean Break\"**\n\n \n\nApart from the share of joint capital, a wife may also be entitled to periodic maintenance. It is the court's duty to consider whether a \"clean break\" (i.e. to terminate the financial dependency of one party against another party) is appropriate on each case.\n\n \n\n\"Clean break\" refers to the distribution of property and/or payment of one lump sum (in one go or by instalments) once and for all, so that the parties can put behind their unhappiness behind and start afresh without having to be reminded of the grievances of the breakdown of marriage or going through the burden of litigation again (e.g. to enforce for the arrears of periodical payments).\n\n \n\nThe rationale for making a lump sum order is to meet the wife’s reasonable requirements, and to recognize her contribution as a mother to the children and/or wife to the marriage. If she has actively participated in the family business or provided finance to the business, the lump sum award will be increased over and above her reasonable requirements so as to recognize the fact that she has ‘earned’ a share in the family assets.\n\n \n\nHowever, no lump sum order will be made unless the respondent has capital assets out of which to pay it without crippling his earning power.\n\n \n\n***Is \"clean break\" possible?\\***\n\n \n\nSubject to the financial strength of the party being asked to provide maintenance (usually the husband), if there is a great antipathy and tension between the parties, the Court will usually strive to achieve a clean break if possible.\n\n \n\nThe amount of the lump sum required to achieve a 'clean break' varies from case to case. It is closely linked to the level and duration of maintenance that the applicant (usually the wife) could otherwise expect. The lump sum should cover the applicant's financial needs for that period.\n\n \n\nIf necessary, accountants can come up with a figure that takes the various factors into account, including the life span of a party, the predicted rates of interest and inflation. But such exercise is very costly and should only be taken if they are helpful and provide material assistance to the Court. Unnecessary use of accountants or experts is highly discouraged and would increase costs.\n\n \n\n***Considerations for the husband\\***\n\n \n\nA husband's liability to pay maintenance to his divorced wife ceases upon her remarriage.\n\n \n\nThus, if it is likely that his divorced wife will remarry in the near future, it will not be in his interests to pay a large capital (cash and/or real estate) to achieve a clean break. This is because such capital is not repayable upon her remarriage.\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, he should not forget that clean break, if achieved, would terminate his divorced wife's financial dependency on him. The husband can then put all the shadow and unhappiness of the marriage behind him and start a new life.\n\n \n\n***Considerations for the wife\\***\n\n \n\nAs to the wife in a clean break situation, it is beneficial to her because she has financial independence. She is in possession of the capital sum and has the flexibility to use the money as she wishes. She does not have to go through the burden of litigation again (e.g. to enforce for the arrears of periodical payments; any possible application by her husband to vary the level of maintenance downwards by reason of his own change of circumstances).\n\n \n\nThe downside of having a clean break is that the lump sum is awarded on an once and for all situation. If the capital turns out to be insufficient to meet her needs or she fails to budget or invest it wisely, there is no point of return. She could not go back to Court and claim against her husband again. This holds true even if her divorced husband becomes rich after the divorce.\n\n \n\n**e. Ownership of a business**\n\n \n\nIf a husband derives his income mostly from his own business which has a capital value, dispute can arise as to the valuation of the business.\n\n \n\nIf the business has its own premises or worthy possessions (real estate, cash, stocks, equipment etc), then valuations of these assets can be obtained by appointing a qualified person (e.g. accountants) to do so. If the business is not going to be sold either now or in the near future, its main value is the income which it would generate. This is in particular so if the husband is going to pay periodic maintenance to the wife and/or children, who will benefit from the continuity of the business, which would generate regular incomes.\n\n \n\nThe reason why disputes can arise between the parties is because business valuations provided by accountants instructed on behalf of each party are often very different, as different accounting approaches may be used.\n\n \n\nIn practice, the accountant appointed by the husband would usually adopt an approach that would result in a relatively low capital value of the business while the wife's accountant would tend to take an approach that would reflect the 'true picture' of the business worth. If the accountants cannot agree on a valuation, they may have to be called to give evidence at the hearing. This is likely to be rather costly.",

Although there is a [common law](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary#c) presumption that the husband should maintain the wife, the law does not differentiate claims made by a wife against her husband and claims made by a husband against his wife. The same duty is imposed by statute (law) on a wife, if she does have the financial resources.

        "answer": "In circumstances where a wife is not in need of any maintenance at the time of divorce but wishes to retain her rights to apply for the same in future, she can seek a **nominal maintenance order**. This might perhaps be a payment of HK$1 per annum which in practice is never actually made.\n\n \n\nHowever, such order is subject to the possibility of variation subsequently. Husbands should be aware that by agreeing to pay nominal maintenance, there is a risk that they may find themselves having to pay a higher level of maintenance in the future. From a wife’s point of view, a nominal order will give her a sense of security as her maintenance claim is reserved rather than dismissed.",

        "question": "IF THERE IS A CHANGE OF FINANCIAL STATUS FOR A SPOUSE, WILL THE MAINTENANCE ORDER BE SUBSEQUENTLY ADJUSTED OR VARIED BY THE COURT?",
        "answer": "As periodic maintenance payments can last for a number of years, their level is open to variation if there is a subsequent change in the circumstances of either party such as the loss of employment or inflation.\n\n \n\nThe original order can be varied to reflect the change in circumstances.\n\n \n\nNote that no [clean break](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/familyMatrimonialAndCohabitation/all) can be achieved with child's maintenance, which can always be varied, according to the needs of the child. It is usually varied upwards as the child grows older and becomes more expensive to maintain.\n\n \n\n***Example one:*** Mr. A applied for a reduction in the payments he was making to his ex-wife because he had been made redundant and the only replacement job he could find had a considerably lower salary. The Court may accept that he could no longer afford to pay at the old rate.\n\n \n\n***Example two:*** Connie found two years after the award of financial maintenance that she could no longer manage on the maintenance she was receiving. Her former husband had received a pay rise and agreed that the payments should be increased. The original order may be varied to reflect such change of circumstances.\n\n \n\nSometimes parties would agree that maintenance should be increased annually by a certain percentage or in line with an established inflation measuring index. This can avoid making costly regular applications back to the Court.\n\n \n\nHowever, note that not all kinds of court orders can be varied.\n\n \n\nThe following orders can be varied:\n\n \n\n- Interim maintenance (Maintenance pending suit)\n- Periodical payments\n- The instalments by which a lump sum is payable\n- An order for the sale of property.\n\nThe following orders cannot be varied:\n\n \n\n- Lump sum orders\n- Property adjustment orders\n\nThat is because these orders (lump sum orders & property adjustment orders) are 'once and for all' orders. They are intended to create finality in litigation so that the parties can put their antipathy behind and plan for the future without worrying about whether an order will be overturned.",

        "question": "IF I GOT A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AFTER THE DIVORCE (E.G. WINNING LOTTERY OR INHERIT A FORTUNE FROM FAMILY), DO I HAVE TO SHARE WITH MY EX-SPOUSE FROM THE MAINTENANCE?",
        "answer": "This Question can be answered in two parts:-\n\n \n\n**Before the granting of maintenance order**\n\n \n\nThe Court in assessing maintenance to be made for a divorced spouse is obliged to have regard not only to the financial resources and needs, obligations and responsibilities which the parties have at present, but also prospective assets which each of them is likely to have in the foreseeable future.\n\n \n\nProspective assets include, but not limited to, lump sum pension payable on retirement, capital sum due to be received under a settlement or which might be received on the dissolution of a partnership, gratuity payable on termination of contract etc. In many cases, the prospective asset consists not of something in which the party already has a vested or contingent interest but simply something which he or she is likely to inherit.\n\n \n\nThe issue is whether the asset is one which the party is likely to have in the foreseeable future. If it is, then the Court will have regard to it in considering whether to make a lump sum order, or whether to adjourn the application for further payment.\n\n \n\nThus, where the husband has reasonable prospect of receiving substantial assets, it may affect the amount of the lump sum which he is ordered to pay to the wife, or they may justify an order which provides the wife with capital or further capital on the happening of a future event or they may make it appropriate to adjourn her application until that event occurs.\n\n \n\nBecause of the Court's duty to have regard to the foreseeable future, it is necessary to take into consideration not only existing liabilities but also those which are likely to be incurred in the foreseeable future.\n\n \n\nSimilarly, the prospective assets and liabilities of the wife have to be taken into account in the application for maintenance.\n\n \n\n**After the order of maintenance was granted**\n\n \n\nThe Court has wide powers to vary or discharge certain orders (whether or not made by consent) or to temporarily suspend and revive any provision contained therein.\n\n \n\nThe Court has a wide discretion in variation proceedings. It can take into account increases in both the capital and income resources of the payer.\n\n \n\nThere is a recent UK Court of Appeal case ruling that when seeking variation of periodical payments, there is no need to show a change of circumstances, or an exceptional or material change of circumstances. As the Court has an absolute discretion, it can look at the case afresh, and need not regard the original order as the starting point.\n\n \n\nHowever, when exercising its powers in variation proceedings, the Court must consider all the circumstances of the case, it must give first consideration to the welfare of any child of the family aged under 18, and any changes of circumstance including any change in any of the matters to which the Court was required to have regard when making the original order.\n\n \n\nThe Court will be vigilant to ensure that the variation application is not a disguised form of appeal.",

        "question": "WHAT CAN THE WIFE/HUSBAND DO IF THE OTHER PARTY REFUSED OR FAILED TO MAKE MAINTENANCE PAYMENT?",
        "answer": "You may consider the following ways to enforce the court order for maintenance against your spouse:\n\n \n\n**a. Judgment summons**\n\n \n\nYou can apply for a judgment summons according to [Rule 87](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/reg/179A/s87) of the [Matrimonial Causes Rules](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/reg/179A) to summon your spouse to the court to reveal his or her financial strength to settle the arrears (\"Examination Summons\") or to commit your spouse to prison (\"Committal Summons\"). The examination process and committal process are separate and distinct and must be applied for separately under separate procedures.\n\n \n\nThere should be no delay in pursuing for the outstanding amount as the court might refuse to enforce the order of payment for those arrears due more than 12 months before proceedings to enforce the payment of them have begun.\n\n \n\nUnder the Examination Summons, the judge has the power to make a new order for payment of the amount due. If your spouse fails to attend the hearing, the court will adjourn the case to a further hearing and order your spouse to attend the adjourned hearing. If he or she still fails to attend on the adjourned hearing, the judge can issue an warrant of arrest against him or her. The bailiff will be ordered to arrest your spouse and bring him or her to the court.\n\n \n\nUnder the Committal Summons, the judge can commit your spouse to prison if he or she cannot justify his or her failure to pay. Any committal to prison can be suspended on terms that your spouse settles the arrears or makes relevant arrangements.\n\n \n\n**b. Attachment of income to satisfy order**\n\n \n\nWith reference to [section 28](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/192/s28.html) of the [Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/192/), where a maintenance order has been made against a maintenance payer and:\n\n \n\n1. a court is satisfied that the payer has without reasonable excuse failed to make any payment which he is required to make by the maintenance order; or\n2. a court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the payer will not make full and punctual payment in compliance with the maintenance order; or\n3. the payer and designated payee agree to the making of an order under this section; and\n\nthere is any income capable of being attached payable to the payer,\n\n \n\nthe Court may order the income to be attached as to the whole or part of the amount payable under the maintenance order and the amount attached to be paid directly from the payer's sources of income (e.g. his/her employer) to the specified payee. However, the payer could retain certain amount for his/her reasonable living expenses before such deduction.\n\n \n\n**c. Prohibition order**\n\n \n\nIt is possible to apply to the Court on an ex-parte basis (applied unilaterally by one of the parties only) for an order that your spouse be prevented from leaving Hong Kong pending recovery of the debt.\n\n \n\nIf granted, the order is served on the Director of Immigration and your spouse will not be allowed to depart if he or she attempts to leave Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nThis procedure can be very effective in particular when your spouse travels frequently as it is likely to cause your spouse considerable inconvenience. However, you should bear in mind that the Court is reluctant to limit a person's liberty in this way. Therefore such an application should only be made as a last resort only when every other method of enforcement has been exhausted and proved inappropriate.",

It is important to point out that the making of a sole custody order to one parent does not remove the other parent's right to be involved in his or her child's upbringing. Such a parent is always able to make an application to the Court on any individual question of the child's welfare and to ask the Court to rule on a dispute.\n\n \n\nFurther, even if a parent has sole custody, the Court would disapprove of that parent making a major change to the child's life without at least informing the other parent, assuming that the parents were still in contact with each other.",

The payments will continue until the death of the payee (not the payer, the party making payment), or the remarriage of payee, or an earlier date as specified by the Court. This order will only be imposed if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the common periodical payments order will be ineffective to carry out in practice and there are sufficient funds or assets of the payer whereby the payments can be secured e.g. where the payer has sufficient means but has a history of failing to abide by order so made (as in the interim maintenance order), poor record of financial irresponsibility, or has vowed to resist payment of maintenance if so ordered.\n\n \n\n**(2) Lump Sum Order** – It is an order for the payment of a capital sum in which the payee is entitled to one lump sum only. This order is closely related to the ‘clean break’ sought by a claimant. The capital sum payable under such order can be paid in various instalments. However, this order cannot be varied subsequently, because it is an ‘once and for all’ order that are intended to create finality in litigation.\n\n \n\n**(3) Property Adjustment Order** – It is an order whereby one party is ordered to transfer to another his or her interest in property such as real properties, stocks, or car, etc. This kind of order, once made, cannot be varied.",

In general, a payer can apply to the Court for variation of maintenance order if there is a change in circumstances (e.g. being bankrupt, made redundant, etc.) that render him unable or reduce his ability to pay the maintenance.",

Depending on the circumstances, it may be necessary for the husband (Mr. J) to continue to pay, or at least to partly contribute to, the mortgage repayments. This can either be effected by direct payment to the mortgagee or through the maintenance paid to Ms. A.\n\n \n\nIn circumstances where the property (and therefore the mortgage) is to be held in the wife's sole name and the wife does not have an independent income of her own, the mortgagee may require the husband to guarantee the payments.",

        "answer": "For spouses from overseas (other than Mainland China), if they wish to enter Hong Kong to reside, they need to apply for a dependant visa. They must show that they are dependants of their spouses who are either Hong Kong permanent resident or a resident who is not subject to a limit of stay (i.e. a resident with the right to land or on unconditional stay).\n\n \n\nThe following conditions must be satisfied for a successful dependant visa application:\n\n- Reasonable proof of a genuine relationship between the applicant (“dependant”) and the spouse residing in Hong Kong (“sponsor”);\n- the applicant should be of clear criminal records and raise no security or criminal concerns for the HKSAR;\n- the sponsor can substantially support the dependant and provide suitable accommodation during his/her stay in Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nFor more details, please refer to [Matrimonial Matters > Marriage and co-habitant issues > Marrying non-HK residents](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/familyMatrimonialAndCohabitation/marraige_and_cohabitant_issues/marrying_non-HK_residents).",

        "answer": "Adultery is one of the reasons a party can use to prove that the marriage has broken down irretrievably, which is the legal grounds for divorce in Hong Kong. You have to establish the fact of adultery. You have to show that your wife has committed adultery, and you find it intolerable to live with her. However, if you and your wife continue to live together for more than six months following the act of adultery, you will not be entitled to rely on the fact of adultery. Besides, you must have certain knowledge that adultery has occurred, not only a belief that there has been adultery.\n\n \n\nTo know more about this, please go to the [Adultery](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/familyMatrimonialAndCohabitation/divorce/proceduresAndGroundsForDivorce/q1/adultery) section.",

The most important fact is that, regardless of how long the cohabitants have been living together, cohabitant couples are not recognized as married couples under the law.

        "answer": "If a party to the marriage passes away after the decree nisi was granted but before it was made absolute, the petition and decree nisi will not be revoked. The action and proceedings for divorce will end when a party passes away. The end of the action also means that the decree nisi will not be made absolute.\n\n \n\nA decree nisi is not the final order declaring that a marriage is dissolved. If a spouse passes away before the decree is made absolute, the will of the deceased spouse (if any) will still be executed as if the couple were still married. This means the surviving spouse will be entitled to the benefits provided under the deceased spouse’s will (if any) as the widow or widower of the deceased.\n\n \n\nOnce one of the spouses dies, the surviving spouse will not be able to make any financial claims against the estate of the deceased spouse under the divorce proceedings. Instead, the surviving spouse may be able to claim reasonable financial provision from the deceased spouse’s estate under the [Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependents) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/481) ([Cap. 481](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/481)). The surviving spouse can make an application to receive reasonable financial support.\n\n \n\nA former wife or former husband of the deceased (i.e. the decree absolute was granted before the deceased passed away) can also claim financial provision under the aforesaid [Cap. 481](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/481), if he/she has not remarried and can show that he/she received financial maintenance from the deceased before their death.",

This means the court will have custody over the child, and care and control will be delegated to a person to look after the child. Any interested party can make this application, including relatives of a child or the Director of Social Welfare.\n\n \n\nAccording to [section 13](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/13/s13.html) of the [Guardianship of Minors Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/13) ([Cap. 13](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/13)), if it appears to the courts that there are exceptional circumstances that make it impracticable or undesirable to entrust a child to either of the parents, the court can appoint the Director of Social Welfare to take care of the child.\n\n \n\nThere are currently 3 places in Hong Kong that a child can be taken to a place of refuge so that he/she can be protected or taken care of:\n\n- Po Leung Kuk;\n- Tuen Mun Children and Juvenile Home;\n- Po Leung Kuk Wing Lung Bank Golden Jubilee Sheltered Workshop and Hostel",

The parties can cross-examine the social welfare officer and/or adduce evidence to challenge any matters contained in the report. A party can put forward their case to the court that the social welfare report should be rejected and provide evidence for this, but the court would not call for another report.

        "question": "IF THE PROPERTY IS OWNED BY A PARTY IN MAINLAND CHINA OR OVERSEAS, HOW WOULD THE PARTY'S INTEREST BE CONSIDERED BY THE COURT IN AWARDING GRANTING ANCILLARY RELIEF?",
        "answer": "The court will look at the parties’ assets and property outside of Hong Kong. As long as the Mainland China or overseas property was acquired during the marriage of the parties, it is very likely that the court will consider it as part of the matrimonial pot (or assets). The court will then decide on the division of matrimonial assets all together according to [section 7(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/192/s7.html) of the [Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/192) and the principles laid down in LKW v DD.",

If the parties do not have a lot of money, the pensions would be brought into the pool of assets and be split so that the parties’ needs can be met. It is only when there are surplus funds for division can the parties and the court consider excluding the pensions from the matrimonial pot or not.",

        "question": "TO AVOID THE MAINTENANCE ORDER, MY HUSBAND DELIBERATELY QUIT HIS JOB AND APPLIED FOR COMPREHENSIVE SOCIAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE (CSSA) UPON RECEIPT OF THE DIVORCE PETITION. WHEN CONSIDERING HIS EARNING CAPACITY AND INCOME, WOULD THAT KIND OF TRICK WORK?",
        "answer": "The court will not only look at the husband’s earning capacity and income at that present moment. As stated in [section 7(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/192/s7.html) of the [Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/192), the court will also take into account the husband’s earning capacity and income in the foreseeable future. If the husband is still capable of finding a job and working to support himself, the court will consider this in deciding how to split the matrimonial assets and when making a maintenance order. Therefore, if the husband is making an obvious attempt to avoid providing maintenance, this trick may not work.\n\n \n\nThere is no automatic exemption for CSSA recipients to pay maintenance. In all cases for ancillary relief, the courts will have regard to the principles laid down in [section 7](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/192/s7.html) of the [Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/192) ([Cap. 192](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/192)) and LKW v DD. That said, the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of each party remain an important concern in making the relevant order. Further note that under [section 7(1)(g)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/192/s7.html), in making an ancillary order, the court will have regard to 'the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage, that party will lose the chance of acquiring'. Thus whether a CSSA recipient will be ordered to pay maintenance depends on the relative wealth of the parties and if CSSA is given on a household basis, whether the parties would lose such social benefits.\n\n \n\nThe amount of CSSA received is calculated at 'Recognized Needs' minus 'Assessable Income'. 'Assessable Income' includes maintenance. Thus, it is advisable for CSSA recipients to disclose their maintenance to SWD as the maintenance amount will be regarded as an evaluation condition for receiving CSSA.\n",

The court may take this into account when distributing assets if it does not require any detailed retrospective investigation and the evidence is clear. However, it should be noted that it is not the function of the family court to deal with substantial debt claims.

If he/she still fails to file the Form E before the deadline, he/ she could be found in contempt of court. You can then make an application to the court that the other side has ignored or failed to comply with a court order. A person found in contempt of court may be committed, that is, imprisoned for a period of time. The court also has the power to refuse to hear submissions from a party in contempt of court until they have purged their contempt, known as a “Hadkinson order”.",

This is presented to the court for consideration. If the court finds that there is non-disclosure, the untruthful party may be punished.\n\n \n\nThe usual sanction for a failure to make adequate financial disclosure is in an adverse costs order, that is, (i) the parties should bear their own costs, (ii) a successful but non-compliant party should lose entitlement to part of its costs, or (iii) in the most serious cases, a party should pay indemnity costs. In addition, the court may draw an adverse inference that would affect the ultimate division of the marital assets.\n\n \n\nParties are reminded to be careful in obtaining documents belonging to the other party that may be private and confidential. ‘Self-help’ remedies like going through the other party’s private computer or locked and password protected safe to get evidence is frowned upon by the court (see *Sim Kon Fah v JBPB & Co* [2001] 4 HKLRD 45).",

        "question": "WHAT FACTORS WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE COURT IN AWARDING USE OR POSSESSION OF THE MATRIMONIAL HOME (THE MAIN RESIDENTIAL HOME OF A COUPLE)?",
        "answer": "That would depend very much on the family's needs, resources and all the other aforesaid factors that the Court is required to consider.\n\n \n\nMatrimonial home is often the parties' most valuable asset.\n\n \n\nThe nature of the matrimonial home is one of the material factors to be considered.\n\n \n\n**i. Rented home**\n\n \n\nEither one party (usually the party who is responsible for looking after the daily welfare of the children) will remain in the rented home, so as to maintain status quo for the children. As to the responsibility for the payment of rent in such case, it would depend on the facts of each case.\n\n \n\nAlternatively, where circumstances warrant, alternative accommodation will be found for both parties.\n\n \n\n**ii. Quarters provided by an employer of a spouse**\n\n \n\nIf a quarter is provided by one of the parties' employer, the other party will usually have to vacate upon divorce, as he / she is no longer the spouse of the other party.\n\n \n\nIn such circumstances, the vacating party may have the right to claim for the costs of alternative accommodation from the other party, as it would be his / her substantial \"needs\".\n\n \n\n**iii. If the parties own their home**\n\n \n\nThe Court has a wide discretion to order the transfer of matrimonial home, in whoever's name(s) it is held, by way of a [property adjustment order](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/familyMatrimonialAndCohabitation/divorce/financialMatters/q4), or[ payment of a lump sum](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/familyMatrimonialAndCohabitation/divorce/financialMatters/q4) necessitating its sale. The following options are opened:\n\n \n\n\\1. Sale\n\n\nThe property can be sold by agreement.\n\nThe net sale proceeds can be split in different combination: i.e. equal shares, agreed shares or a percentage of share decided by the Court as it sees fit.\n\nThe particular circumstances of each party's contributions, needs and liabilities will dictate the amount of shares each party would be entitled to e.g. the need to re-house the children or to redeem a mortgage.\n\n \n\n\\2. Transfer\n \n\nOwnership of the property can be transferred from one party to the other either outright or upon payment of a sum of money (while the title in the property remains in the payer).\n\nGenerally, if there are children who are going to live with the wife, to maintain status quo, an attempt will be made to preserve the matrimonial home for them rather than for the husband. Of course, this is subject to the facts of each case in particular the parties' resources.\n\nIf the Court found that the value of the property being transferred is more than the wife's total entitlement to capital, then for the sake of fairness, the wife is expected to compensate the husband by paying him a lump sum equivalent to the ascertained \"gain\".\n\nIf the wife cannot immediately compensate her husband for the \"gain\", the property can be transferred into the wife's name subject to the husband's legal charge on the property (in the same way as a mortgage). In this case, the husband can maintain an interest which can be expressed as a lump sum or as a percentage share of the property. His interest can be realized at a later date.\n\nIf both parties are unable to discharge the mortgage on the matrimonial home immediately, subject to the approval of the mortgagee, the mortgage will also have to be transferred into the wife's name. In such case, the wife will be responsible for the repayment of the mortgage. If the wife does not have an independent income or stable income, the mortgagee may require the husband to guarantee the repayment of mortgage.\n\n \n\n\\3. Joint ownership\n \n\nIf one party wants to reside in the matrimonial home upon divorce, where the circumstances warrant, such as the child is living there and the parties have sufficient financial resources, the matrimonial home can be retained in joint names and have it sold at a later specified date such as when the child has reached a specified age or finished his / her full-time education, whichever is the later.\n\nUpon sale, the net sale proceeds would be divided in equal shares, agreed shares, or a percentage of shares that the Court sees fit.\n\nUnless and until the matrimonial home is sold, the party who lives with the children would be granted exclusive occupation.\n\n \n\n\\4. Where both parties have an interest in the home\n\nThere are circumstances whereby the husband is retaining an interest either in the matrimonial home or an alternative accommodation.\n\nThis is particularly so where the husband has an ongoing commitment to the repayment of mortgage.\n\nThe husband's interest can either be secured by joint ownership, or by a legal charge on the property whereby his interest can be expressed as a lump sum or as a percentage share of the property.\n\nIn either situation, the parties had to agree as to when the husband will be able to realize his interest.\n\nThe following events are usually the specified time:\n\n- Upon the death, remarriage, or cohabitation of the wife;\n- When the child or the youngest child has reached a specified age or completed his or her full-time education; or\n- When both parties reached agreement for sale.\n\nHowever, this type of arrangement is a viable option only if the husband is quite well-off and does not need capital immediately.\n\nThere is a risk for the wife is this option is invoked. Although the wife can enjoy exclusive occupation (with children, if any) of the matrimonial home for quite some time, she will have to accommodate herself from her share of the net sale proceeds when the matrimonial home is eventually sold (unless she has other resources).\n\nIf her share of the net sale proceeds turns out to be insufficient (to acquire another replacement property), she has no other capital or mortgage potential to resort to.\n\nAlso, one should not overlook the fact that whenever both parties have an interest in the matrimonial home, there is a potential for conflict. Thus, If possible, avoid such kind of settlement, as the parties have already suffered enough tension and antipathy upon divorce. They should avoid conflict or costly litigation again.\n\nIf it is not feasible, one should try to anticipate potential problems that would arise and make advance provision for their eventuality e.g. payment for interior or external renovation, it is reasonable for each party to contribute to such expenses in accordance with the respective percentage share in the property.",

        "question": "I AM LEGALLY MARRIED IN HONG KONG. IF LATER MY SPOUSE CHANGES SEX, IS MY MARRIAGE STILL VALID?",
        "answer": "Every marriage must be the union of one man and one woman. A person having received a full sex re-assignment surgery is to be treated as being of the sex re-assigned after the surgery. A marriage is void on the ground of “the parties not being respectively male and female”, and such gender should be the gender that has been certified by an appropriate medical authority to have changed as a result of sex reassignment medical treatment.\n\n \n\nIn the Court of Final Appeal decision of [*Q & Tse Henry Edward* v *Commissioner of Registration*](https://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2023/4.html), it was held that the underlying policy of the Commissioner of Registration requiring a full sex reassignment surgery (which involves a highly invasive surgery to remove the uterus and ovaries and construct an artificial penis) before amending the gender markers on their HKID cards, was unconstitutional. In other words, the completion of full sex reassignment surgery is not a necessary condition for amending the gender markers on transgender persons’ HKID cards. The appellants in that case have been medically certified that additional surgical procedures are not needed, the surgery carries certain post-operative risks and possible complications, and is medically unnecessary for many transgender persons, including the appellants.\n\n \n\nTherefore, if your spouse changes sex later in the marriage (having been medically\n\ncertified and recognised as the changed gender), he/she would be recognised as persons of their re-assigned sex and the marriage would be void by reasons of not being heterosexual, as same-sex marriage is not legalised in Hong Kong.",

        "question": "DO SAME-SEX COUPLES NEED TO GO BACK TO COUNTRIES WHERE THEY GOT MARRIED TO GET DIVORCED? DO THEY NEED TO UPDATE THEIR MARITAL STATUS TO THE HONG KONG GOVERNMENT AS DIVORCED?",
        "answer": "Hong Kong law does not extend jurisdiction for divorce or decree of nullity to foreign same-sex marriage. Jurisdiction was extended under the [Domestic and Cohabitation Relationships Violence Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/189) ([Cap. 189](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/189)) to encompass officially non-recognised relationships for some protective reliefs against domestic violence.\n\n \n\nThus, same-sex couples may need to go back to countries where they got married or go to other countries that recognise dissolution of foreign same-sex marriage for their divorce. They have no obligation to update their marital status to the Hong Kong government unless it is required for other purposes such as welfare rights, housing policy or taxation or as required by law (such as to remarry in Hong Kong).",

        "question": "HOW TO PROVE THAT A MARRIAGE IS A BOGUS MARRIAGE?",
        "answer": "The Immigration Department may carry out in-depth investigations in suspicious cases, such as conducting spot checks by home visits to collect circumstantial evidence and proof, conducting separate interviews, and obtaining admissions of the parties involved in a bogus marriage. Information may be gathered via different channels to verify the husband-and-wife relationships of the persons in the case, by asking questions on details of matrimonial relationships, checking on recollection of ceremonies and gifts, conducting inquiries of special memory of font moments, and seeking the provision of photos and videos, traces of living together as husband and wife, with support of objective evidence like the entry and exit record, etc. Lack of time spent or personal belongings of one party at home may bring the officers to doubt the existence of matrimonial relations.\n\n \n\nIn some cases, officers may be able to find the parties’ contact with criminal syndicates arranging for bogus marriages, such as communication with a phone number provided in the advertisements to allure people to engage in bogus marriages, or a search may render pieces of evidence such as a memo of personal details of the spouse or teaching notes on how to answers questions and inquiries from Immigration Department.",

        "question": "IF I AM INVOLVED IN A BOGUS MARRIAGE, DOES THIS AUTOMATICALLY MEAN A NULLITY OF MARRIAGE?",
        "answer": "A bogus marriage does not automatically mean a nullity of marriage, and the court has determined whether bogus marriage should be annulled under [section 20](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/179/s20.html) of [Matrimonial Causes Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/179) ([Cap. 179](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/179)). The petition for nullity is dismissed as under the relevant statutory regime of “grounds for decree of nullity”, there is no mentioning of a bogus marriage being a ground to declare the marriage void.\n\n \n\nThe Court of Final Appeal has commented that a bogus marriage was still a marriage in the eyes of the law, even if no affection was involved nor the parties had slightest intention of living together or behaving in any way like a married couple - the alleged “bogus” part referred to the application to the Immigration Department for the purposes of which the marriage was entered into.\n\n \n\nA petition for divorce rather than a petition for nullity should be filed by a petitioner who wants to end a bogus marriage.",

        "question": "DO FATHERS HAVE PARENTAL RIGHTS OVER ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN? IF AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD IS BORN WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THE FATHER DURING THE BIRTH REGISTRATION, CAN THE FATHER CLAIM THE PARENTAL RIGHTS LATER? IS CONSENT FROM THE MOTHER NEEDED? IS ANY PROOF (E.G., DNA REPORTS) NEEDED?",
        "answer": "The father of an illegitimate child does not automatically enjoy parental rights, but he needs to apply to the court claiming for a declaration deeming him as the father and entitling him to parental rights under [section 3](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/13/s3.html) of the [Guardianship of Minors Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/13) ([Cap. 13](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/13)). The paramount consideration is the best interest of the child and the court has identified the following facts in consideration of the application:\n\n1. the father’s degree of commitment to the child;\n2. the state of the father’s current relationship with the child and\n3. his reasons for making the application.\n\nA mother’s refusal to consent to the applicant or her hostility towards the father of the illegitimate child would not on its own be a reason to refuse the application. The father could claim the parental rights even if the child is born without acknowledging the father during the birth registration. However, in contested cases where the mother does not consent to the application, the burden is on the applicant (father of the illegitimate child) to prove parentage. The court often order proof of parentage by means of scientific evidence such as a DNA paternity test in proceedings involving paternity disputes, which would be the most direct and relevant proof beyond doubt, and any party refusing such a test would face drawing of adverse inferences from court unless cogent reasons are given to persuade the court otherwise.",

        "question": "CAN A YOUNG PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF 18 RECEIVE A PLASTIC SURGERY DESPITE THE OPPOSITION FROM PARENTS?",
        "answer": "In general, a person who has attained the age of 18 has the capacity to give consent in Hong Kong. There is no specific law governing plastic surgery but for medical treatment. According to the Medical Council of Hong Kong's Code of Professional Conduct Guide, consent given by a child patient is not valid unless the child is capable of understanding the nature and implication of the proposed medical treatment. If the child is not capable of such understanding, consent has to be obtained from the child’s parent or guardian. If the parental agreement is not obtained, medical practitioners could only lawfully act to safeguard a child’s life or health on the basis of necessity. In practice, although it is not a legal requirement, many public and private hospitals in Hong Kong require parental consent for a child under 18 to undergo medical treatment.\n\n \n\nParents’ right to determine the treatment is not absolute and could be overruled by the court considering the best interest of the child. In some cases, plastic surgery may be required after cancer, trauma or severe abnormalities that could have major impact on the child’s health and welfare.\n\n \n\nSome medical instruments, medication and implants may have a suggested minimum age for warranty by the manufacturer and it is highly unlikely a registered medical practitioner would take such risk for purely cosmetic purposes, although strictly speaking it may not be illegal to use such medical device.",

        "question": "IS THERE ANY BENEFIT IN THE TRIAL OF CHILDREN ISSUES AND ANCILLARY RELIEF IF THE COURT ACCEPTS MY SPOUSE’S ADULTERY AS PROOF OF THE GROUND OF THE DIVORCE?",
        "answer": "In general, adultery has no bearing on the determination of child custody and granting of ancillary relief.\n\n \n\nThe court may take into account obvious and gross misconduct if the matrimonial assets are dramatically reduced by excessive spending, so obviously extravagant overspending on mistress is a type of misconduct taken into account by court when considering the distribution of the matrimonial assets. However, the allegation of adultery without financial impact would have less relevance on the issue of ancillary relief.\n\n \n\nThere is also no benefit in the trial of children custody even if the fact of adultery is established. The best interest of the child is the priority of court so even a cheating parent could be seen as a good caregiver/parent of the child. On the other hand, the court will also ascertain a child’s wish so if extramarital relationship and inappropriate behaviour are exposed to the child leading to the child’s distress or emotional turbulences, there may be some impact on the issue of child custody (for example, the child may not want to live with the parent and the adulterer).",

        "answer": "If a spouse has gone away for more than a year without reasons given, the petitioner can get a divorce out of desertion, but the petitioner is still required to show the intention of the desertion. The act of leaving the matrimonial home without any reasonable cause or the other spouse’s consent is likely sufficient for the court to infer intention of the deserting spouse to bring the cohabitation to an end.

Both parties could recognise that their matrimonial relationship as continuing even though they are physically separated.\n\n \n\nIf due to some unpredictable event (such as COVID-19 pandemic requirements) the parties are separated in two cities, it is possible for the spouse to argue that the couple has not gone through a true separation, subject to further evidence of the circumstances and the view of the parties on whether the marriage is still subsisting.",

IF THE JAIL TERM IS LESS THAN 2 YEARS, CAN THE PETITIONER RELY ON THE DESERTION GROUND? FOR A JAIL TERM OF 2 YEARS OR LONGER, CAN THE TWO YEARS’ SEPARATION GROUND BE APPLIED?",
        "answer": "If the jail term is less than 2 years, it is unlikely that the petitioner can rely on the desertion ground. This is because the other spouse may establish a reasonable cause of forced separation due to imprisonment. He may also show that he has no intention to bring the cohabitation to a permanent end.\n\n \n\nIf a jail term is of 2 years of longer, it is possible to rely on the separation for 2 years ground, which does not require the respondent’s consent. In cases where physical separation is brought about by pressure of external circumstance (like a jail term), if one party intends to end the marriage during that period, such intent should be clearly expressed and/or communicated and there must be indication or recognition that the marriage has ended. This is because a “forced” physical separation may be distinguished from separation brought about by someone walking out of home who naturally intends the consequence of his/her acts (to end a marriage). If you continue to visit your spouse in jail or still hold out yourself as a spouse, it may not be justified as a “true” separation as a ground of divorce.",

They serve as a guide as to when conduct may constitute a contravention of the fair trading sections of the [TDO](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/362/).\n\nThe Guidelines are neither legally binding nor subsidiary legislation. Traders do not incur any civil or criminal liability by contravening any part of the Guidelines.\n\nRather than criminal proceedings, [section 30L](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/362/s30l.html) provides that the Enforcement Agencies may resolve cases in respect of conduct that constitutes an offence under specified sections by accepting a written undertaking from alleged trader if the trader undertakes not to continue/repeat/engage in conduct or commercial practice of the kind or of a substantially similar kind of concern. Acceptance or withdrawal of the undertaking is subject to the consent in writing by the Secretary for Justice. If an undertaking is accepted, the enforcement agency may not commence/continue the investigation or bring/continue the proceedings in court. The enforcement agency may also publish the accepted undertaking.\n\nThe Enforcement Agencies may apply to the court for an injunction to order a trader not to continue or repeat or engage in the contravening conduct (see [sections 30P](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/362/s30p.html) and [30Q](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/362/s30q.html)).\n\nThe Enforcement Agencies are more likely to institute criminal proceedings rather than seeking an undertaking in cases of serious contravention of the fair trading sections of the [TDO](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/362/). Factors (which are non-exhaustive) to be considered are:\n\n- whether the conduct continues over a long period of time or involves a series of contraventions against the same victim or same group of victims;\n- the number of victims and amount of financial loss or other detriment suffered or likely to be suffered by the victim(s);\n- whether the conduct was fabricated, with prior planning;\n- whether the victims are particularly vulnerable;\n- the prevalence of the conduct and its impact on the community, including the risk posed to public health and safety, or to the environment;\n- whether there are elements in the conduct which caused or are likely to cause harassment, anxiety or distress to the victims;\n- any attempt by the trader to conceal his identity, whether directly or indirectly, such that the Enforcement Agency or the victims (or both) cannot easily identify or trace the trader;\n- lack of remorse;\n- the trader's compliance history and conviction record(s); and\n- whether the trader has obstructed the Enforcement Agency in taking lawful action during an investigation.\n\nFor the full content of the Enforcement Guidelines, please click [here](http://www.customs.gov.hk/filemanager/common/pdf/pdf_forms/Enforcement_Guidelines2_en.pdf).\n\n**Gold or Platinum articles**\n\nThere are also regulations under the TDO dealing specifically with gold and platinum articles.\n\nUnder the [Trade Descriptions (Marking) (Gold and Gold Alloy) Order ](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/reg/362A/)([Cap. 362A](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/reg/362A/)) and [Trade Descriptions (Marking) (Platinum) Orders](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/reg/362C/) ([Cap. 362C](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/reg/362C/)), all articles made of gold, gold alloy, or platinum must bear a mark indicating the fineness of gold or platinum content in the form and manner specified. Articles made of different parts of gold or platinum of different fineness, or partly of gold or platinum and partly of other metal must also be clearly marked as such.\n\n**Watches**\n\nUnder [section 2](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/reg/362D/s2.html) of the [Trade Descriptions (Place of Origin) (Watches) Order](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/reg/362D/) ([Cap. 362D](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/reg/362D/)), the place in which the movement of a watch (i.e. the main part of a watch without the watch band) was manufactured or produced is to be regarded as the place in which the watch has been manufactured or produced. However, this requirement does not apply to any watch that has been exported, or is intended to be exported, from Hong Kong to the Mainland under the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) and that is qualified for a zero tariff under the Arrangement.\n\n**Food and Drugs**\n\n[Schedule 3](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/sch3.html) of the [Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/) ([Cap. 132W](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/)) states that unless there is exemption in the Regulations or otherwise stated, the following information should be marked in either English or Chinese language or in both languages on the label of pre-packaged food:\n\n- name of the food;\n- list of ingredients;\n- indication of \"use by\" or \"best before\" date;\n- statement of special conditions for storage or instructions for use;\n- name and address of manufacturer or packer;\n- count, weight or volume of food.\n\nIf Chinese and English languages are used in labelling, the food name and the ingredient list of the pre-packaged food shall be labelled in both languages.\n\n[Regulation 4A](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/s4a.html) of the [Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/) ([Cap. 132W](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/)) provides that prepackaged food shall be marked and labelled in the manner prescribed in [Schedule 3](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/sch3.html). The items listed in [Schedule 4](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/sch4.html) are exempt from the requirements of this regulation to the extent specified in that Schedule.\n\n[Schedule 3](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/sch3.html) states the requirement of \"Count, weight or volume\" in Paragraph 7 and the appropriate language in Paragraph 8.\n\n[Regulation 4B](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/s4b.html) provides that prepackaged food shall be marked or labelled with its energy value and nutrient content in compliance with Part 1 of [Schedule 5](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/sch5.html).\n\nItems exempt from Part 1 of [Schedule 5](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/sch5.html) are listed under [Schedule 6](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/sch6.html).\n\nAny person who advertises for sale, sells or manufactures for sale any prepackaged food which -\n\n(a) is not marked or labelled in compliance with [regulation 4A(1)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/s4a.html) or [4B(1)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/s4b.html); or\n\n(b) has on its label any nutrition claim that does not conform to [regulation 4B(5)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/s4b.html), commits an offence and is liable to a fine at level 5 ( [Criminal Procedure Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/221/) ([Schedule 8](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/221/sch8.html)) and to imprisonment for 6 months.\n\n[Schedule 7](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/sch7.html) provides for the nutrient reference values for different nutrients for the purpose of nutrition labelling and [Schedule 8](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/132W/sch8.html) states the conditions for nutrient content claim.",

        "question": "Goods for sale are not always safe for consumption. How am I protected against faulty or dangerous goods?",
        "answer": "There are several pieces of legislation dealing with the safety of consumers. The most common one is the [Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/456/) ([Cap. 456](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/456/) of the Laws of Hong Kong).\n\nUnder the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance, all consumer goods (except those listed in the [Schedule](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/456/sch.html) to the Ordinance) must comply with the [general safety requirements](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/456/s4.html) or the safety standards and specifications prescribed by the Secretary for Economic Development and Labour. The Ordinance imposes a statutory duty on manufacturers, importers and suppliers to ensure that the consumer goods they supply are reasonably safe. The Ordinance also imposes controls on the advertising of consumer goods.\n\n**Any person who sells unsafe goods is liable to a fine and/or imprisonment.** **Those unsafe goods may also be seized by the Customs and Excise Department and other authorized officers.**\n\nThe Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance does not prescribe mandatory safety tests on products before they are put up for sale. Sellers or suppliers are however encouraged to have their consumer goods tested by an approved laboratory to determine whether or not they are reasonably safe.\n\nIt does not necessarily mean that goods which are not covered under the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance are \"uncontrollable\" or are not currently controlled. These goods are most likely regulated by separate ordinances (examples can be found in [section 3](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/424/s3.html), [section 5](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/424/s5.html) and [section 8](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/424/s8.html) of the Toys and Children's Products Safety Ordinance, Cap. 424). You may contact the [Consumer Council](https://www.consumer.org.hk/ws_en/contactus) or consult a lawyer for further details.\n\n**Warning/caution notice**\n\nThe [Consumer Goods Safety Regulation](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/reg/456A/) ([Cap. 456A](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/reg/456A/)) came into operation in April 1998. The Regulation requires that any warning or caution with respect to the safe keeping, use, consumption or disposal of any consumer goods must be given in **both the Chinese and English languages** . Further, the warning or caution must be legible and placed in a conspicuous position on the consumer goods themselves, on any package containing the consumer goods, or be a label securely affixed to the package, or be a document enclosed within the package.",

        "question": "The goods that I have ordered are delivered to me in poor condition. Can I reject the goods and ask for a refund?",
        "answer": "Generally speaking, sellers have a duty to deliver the goods and buyers have a duty to accept and pay for the goods in accordance with the terms of the contract. [Section 37](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/26/s37.html) of the [Sale of Goods Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/26/) provides that buyers are deemed to have accepted the goods when:\n\n- they tell or intimate to the sellers that they have accepted the goods;\n- when the goods have been delivered to the buyers and they act in relation to the goods in a manner which is inconsistent with the ownership of the sellers (e.g. the buyers claim that they are the owners and then resell the goods); or\n- after a reasonable time they retain the goods without intimating to the sellers that they have rejected the goods (whether a \"reasonable time\" has elapsed can be determined by whether the buyers had a reasonable opportunity to examine the goods).\n\n**Rejection of Goods**\n\nYou are entitled to reject the goods and get your money back if the goods:\n\n- are faulty;\n- are not of satisfactory quality;\n- do not match their descriptions; or\n- are different from the ones you ordered.\n\nIn order to make a valid rejection, there must be a clear indication that the goods were not accepted and remain at the risk of the seller (i.e. the buyer takes no responsibility for the goods). You should call the seller immediately, return the goods by yourself, or ask the person who delivered the goods to take them back.\n\nUnder [section 38](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/26/s38.html) of the [Sale of Goods Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/26/), where goods are delivered to the buyer, and the buyer refuses to accept them with a lawful reason (e.g. the goods are not of satisfactory quality), that buyer is not bound to return them to the seller (although he may still do so). It is sufficient if that buyer intimates to the seller that he refuses to accept them.\n\nA clear and prompt rejection is particularly important if you are not buying at a shop or on the spot. For instance, when you are ordering by phone, fax or on the internet, you don't get to see the products until they are delivered to you, and often you have to pay in advance.\n\n**Return of Goods**\n\nIf you find out some problems on the goods after accepting them , you may not be entitled to return the goods and demand a full refund. However, you can sue the seller for compensation if the seller refuses to replace the goods with the new ones.\n\n**Delivery**\n\nThe seller must deliver your goods by the agreed date. The seller should let you know if the goods can't be delivered on time. If the date for delivery has passed and you haven't received anything, you may treat it as though you had never placed the order (if you have previously emphasized that punctual delivery is necessary). If you have already paid, demand a full refund.",

        "question": "Besides going directly to courts, where else can consumers seek assistance or make complaints?",
        "answer": "Other than contacting the traders directly, you may approach the following organizations:\n\n**Consumer Council**\n\nYou can contact the [Consumer Council](https://www.consumer.org.hk/en/complaints-and-services/complaint-and-enquiry-channels) to seek advice or to make a complaint ( telephone hotline: 29292222 ).\n\nThe Consumer Council is a body corporate subsidized by Government funding. Details of its power, roles and function can be found under the [Consumer Council Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/216/) ([Cap. 216](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/216/) of the Laws of Hong Kong).\n\nThe functions of the Council are stipulated by law and include providing consumers with information on goods and services, acting as mediator in resolving consumer complaints, tendering advice on policies touching on consumer rights and interest, and encouraging businesses and professional associations to establish codes of practice.\n\nSince the Council is not a law-enforcement body , it has no authority to sue traders. The relevant complaints are dealt with by way of mediation. However, the Council can censure trade mal-practices by naming/publicizing the traders concerned . For cases that involve significant consumer interest but cannot be resolved by mediation or other means, applications for assistance can be made to the [Consumer Legal Action Fund](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/consumer_complaints/channels_for_consumer_complaints/q2).\n\n**Customs and Excise Department**\n\nFor problems concerning \"[trade descriptions](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/consumer_complaints/consumer_protection/q3)\" or \"[safety of goods](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/consumer_complaints/consumer_protection/q4)\", you can also complain to the Customs and Excise Department directly (general enquiry hotline- 28157711; complaint hotline - 81003553). The Department will entertain complaints concerning:\n\n- short weights and measures;\n- overstating the fineness of gold and platinum;\n- unsafe toys and children's products;\n- unsafe consumer goods;\n- discrepancies involving the rough diamonds certification scheme.\n\nFor more details concerning the above, please visit the [Customs and Excise Department's webpage](http://www.customs.gov.hk/en/contact_us/consumer_protection/index.html).\n\n**Communications Authority**\n\nFor problems concerning trade practices in relation to telecommunications and broadcasting, you can complain to [Communications Authority](http://www.ofca.gov.hk/en/contact_us/enquiry/index.html) directly.\n\n**Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong (complaints against travel agents)**\n\nThe Travel Industry Council (\"TIC\") is entrusted with the responsibility to regulate outbound and inbound travel agents under the [Travel Agents Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/218/) ([Cap. 218](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/218/) of the Laws of Hong Kong). Its mission is to maintain a high standard of professionalism within the industry and to protect the interests of both the traders and travellers.\n\nThe TIC provides the following services to the public:\n\n- handle consumer complaints;\n- to help travellers apply for ex-gratia payment from the Travel Industry Compensation Fund and financial assistance from the Package Tour Accident Contingency Fund Scheme;\n- to promote consumer awareness of travel protection and travel safety;\n- 24-hour public service hotline: 2969 8188;\n- inbound tourist service hotline: 2807 0707.\n\nThe TIC website contains a list of FAQs on possible consumer complaints for [inbound travel](http://www.tichk.org/public/website/en/faqs/inbound/index.html) and [outbound travel](http://www.tichk.org/public/website/en/faqs/outbound/index.html).\n\n**Food and Environmental Hygiene Department**\n\nThe mission of [Food and Environmental Hygiene Department](http://www.fehd.gov.hk/) (\"FEHD\") is to work hand in hand with the community in building Hong Kong into a world-class metropolis renowned for its food safety and public hygiene.\n\nContact details:\n\n- address: 44/F Queensway Government Offices, 66 Queensway, Hong Kong;\n- fax: 2869 0169;\n- 24-hour enquiry and complaint hotline: 2868 0000;\n- e-mail: [enquiries@fehd.gov.hk](mailto:enquiries@fehd.gov.hk)\n\n**The Insurance Complaints Bureau**\n\nThe Insurance Complaints Bureau (\"ICB\") is a self-regulatory initiative implemented by the insurance industry to protect consumer interest. One of the main objectives of ICB is to receive referrals for complaints relating to claims arising out of personal insurance policies and to facilitate the settlement or withdrawal of such complaints, disputes or claims whether by the making of awards (decisions/verdicts), or by such means as shall seem expedient.\n\nFor more information, please refer to [the relevant question and answer](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/insurance/general_matters_concerning_all_types_of_insurance/q9) in the insurance topic.",

        "question": "If consumers have to institute legal proceedings, what should they pay attention to?",
        "answer": "Apart from complaining to the Consumer Council or the Customs and Excise Department, you can seek the advice of a solicitor. There is always the option of going to court. Sometimes, just telling a bad trader that you may go to court is enough to get your complaint sorted out.\n\n**Small Claims Tribunal**\n\nIf you do decide to go to court, there is a special way of suing for small amounts by using the small claims procedures in the Small Claims Tribunal. **No person can be represented by a lawyer in the Small Claims Tribunal** (but you can consult a lawyer before attending the Tribunal's hearing).\n\nThe most you can claim by using the small claims procedures is **HK$75,000** . If the claim exceeds $75,000, you are not allowed to subdivide it in order to bring to the Tribunal a number of cases that are each below the $75,000 limit. The only way you can bring a claim in excess of the $75,000 limit before the Tribunal is if you abandon any amount above $75,000.\n\nTypes of claims can be handled by the Small Claims Tribunal include:\n\n- debts;\n- service charges;\n- damage to property;\n- consumer claims (e.g. claims relating to goods or services with poor quality).\n\nBefore commencing a formal trial at the Tribunal, the Adjudicator (Tribunal's judge) and the Tribunal Officer will attempt to mediate the dispute between the parties. If both parties agree to settle, the Tribunal will grant a written consent order and further trials or hearings can be avoided.\n\nFor details about the procedures and fees for hearings at the Small Claims Tribunal, please visit the [Judiciary's webpage](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/sc.html).\n\nIf the parties cannot reach an amicable settlement at the first hearing, you need to get ready for the subsequent trial. **To get more information about how to prepare for the trial (from both the Claimant's and the Defendant's perspective), please click** [**here**](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/preparing_for_court_trial/).\n\n**District Court or High Court**\n\nIf the amount of your claim is **over $75,000** , you must submit your claim to the District Court or the High Court. The maximum claim that can be handled by the District Court is $3,000,000. While for the High Court, there is no upper limit on the claim amount. Since the claim amount is bigger and the procedures involved are much more complex, you are strongly advised to find a lawyer to represent you in any proceedings in these 2 courts.\n\n**Financial assistance for consumer legal actions**\n\n**A) Consumer Legal Action Fund**\n\nThe Consumer Council also runs a Consumer Legal Action Fund (\"the Fund\"), which will assist consumers to pursue their matters in courts.\n\nYou can apply for legal assistance under the Fund if you are a consumer or a group of consumers involved in a matter which:\n\n(a) relates to consumer transactions, such as:\n\n1. unmerchantable (poor quality) goods, including food and drugs;\n2. unfair and unconscionable contract terms;\n3. unreasonable exemption clauses in consumer contracts;\n4. false or misleading advertising claims;\n5. false trade descriptions;\n6. any other case of significant consumer interest; or\n\n(b) involves significant public interest or injustice (e.g. other consumers may be affected if the defaulting trader continue to do business).\n\n**In order to be eligible for the Fund, normally you must have already exhausted all other means of resolving the dispute in question, and be unable to qualify for any form of legal aid** .\n\nApplicants for assistance under the Fund need not undergo a mandatory means test in order to qualify for assistance. However the Trustee may take into account an applicant's financial resources in deciding whether to accept or reject a particular case.\n\nThere is a **non-refundable application fee** payable at the time of application. If your case is to be tried in the Small Claims Tribunal, the application fee is HK$100. If your case is to be tried in the District Court or other higher courts, the application fee is HK$1,000.\n\nIf your case is unsuccessful, you need not make any further payment. The Fund pays for all your costs and expenses. On the other hand, if your matter is successful, you will be asked to pay a contribution to the Fund.\n\nFor more information about the Fund, please visit the [Consumer Council's webpage](https://www.consumer.org.hk/en/complaints-and-services/consumer-legal-action-fund).\n\nIf you want to obtain an application form for the Fund, the Consumer Council has provided the form. Please click [here](https://www.consumer.org.hk/f/page/300003/458120/2023.05 CLAF application form (English)(R).pdf) to download the form.\n\n**B) Legal Aid**\n\nIf you are not submitting your claim to the Small Claims Tribunal, and wish to have it tried in the District Court or the High Court, you may apply for legal aid if you satisfy certain conditions set out by the Legal Aid Department.

He has to take into account how old the clothes were and how much wear he has already gotten out of them. Even though there was a notice saying something like \"all garments cleaned entirely at customer's risk\", Mr. B can still make his claim. If the dry cleaner has made a mess of the job then a notice like this won't shield him. An exemption has to be reasonable before it can be enforced (see: [Unreasonable exemption clauses](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/consumer_complaints/consumer_protection/q5)).",

He is not entitled to a refund if:\n\n• he has just changed his mind about the item purchased;\n• before confirming his order, he was told that the goods were damaged or the fault was so obvious that he should have noticed it;\n• he damaged the goods by himself;\n• he subsequently altered the goods (e.g. took up the hem on a skirt); or\n• he has kept the goods for quite a long time without letting the seller know that there was something wrong with the goods (see: [Acceptance and Rejection of Goods](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/consumer_complaints/consumer_protection/q6)).",

        "answer": "If the price has not been confirmed before completing the job, the repairer is entitled to charge a \"reasonable\" rate for the work (section 7 of the Supplied of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance). If Mr. B does not pay what the repairer asks, the repairer is legally entitled to hold onto Mr. B's computer until he pays the fee.\n\nEven though Mr. B may think that he is being overcharged, he will have to pay the money if he wants his computer back. But in the meantime, **Mr. B can make it clear to the repairer that he pays the fee \"under protest\" and that he intends to dispute it** .\n\nMr. B will need to find out what other repairers would have charged for doing the same job. He shall then put it down in writing and send a letter to the repairer confirming that he was paying the bill under protest and demand a refund of the overcharged portion. If the repairer refuses to make a refund, Mr. B can take his case to the Consumer Council or the Small Claims Tribunal (please go to [Channels for Consumer Complaints](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/consumer_complaints/channels_for_consumer_complaints)).",

        "question": "Ms. C has recently purchased some coupons (prepaid coupons) from a beauty salon but that salon suddenly closes down. Can she claim her money back and by what means?",
        "answer": "There is little safeguard on consumer interest in prepayment scheme or coupons. In some cases, a company closes down some time after it has gone into liquidation. In some other cases, a company's business comes to an end without prior notice to the outside world. The reasons for a company's demise can be just as diverse: there may be financial difficulties, fierce competition, retirement, fraud, personal reasons and so forth. Consumers who find themselves in such an unfortunate situation may seek legal advice from lawyers, or contact the Consumer Council and the Police.\n\nIf a [winding-up order](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/bankruptcy_IndividualVoluntaryArrangement_Companies_Winding_up/companies_Winding_up/) has been granted against the company (in case it is a limited company), then the aggrieved consumers are legally entitled to recover their payment for the tickets. However, the consumers will only be treated as ordinary or unsecured creditors on claiming their loss. In reality, this means that the consumers will usually recover no more than a small proportion of the debt.\n\nIn order to be eligible as one of the creditors in a winding-up action, Ms. C has to prove that the company owes her money by completing a [Proof of Debt Form (Form 63A)](https://www.oro.gov.hk/pdf/eng/pforms/proof_of_debt_winding_up.pdf). She must also submit the form to the provisional liquidator or liquidator, together with documentary evidence, if any, after the winding-up order has been made against the company. For more details, please refer to the topic of [Bankruptcy and Winding-up](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/bankruptcy_IndividualVoluntaryArrangement_Companies_Winding_up/).\n\nIf the company closes down suddenly without leaving any assets, the prospect of consumers (holding pre-paid coupons or vouchers) recovering their loss is usually very slim.",

        "answer": "As an overview, a Tenancy Agreement is a binding legal document which has important implications on the committed rights and obligations on the part of both landlord and tenant. The terms of a Tenancy Agreement must be carefully considered before signing.\n\nContrary to the common belief of many lay parties, the potential consequences of breaching a Tenancy Agreement by a tenant may not be only limited to the 'loss' in the amount of the deposit paid to a landlord.\n\nThe same also applies to a landlord where he may become liable or responsible to third parties for any breaches committed by the tenant.\n\nThe contents of a Tenancy Agreement will normally include the period/length of the tenancy, rent, payment period, deposit, use (e.g. residence, office, or factory etc.), renewal terms, termination terms and other usual terms that will be described in the other parts of this topic.\n\nDepending on the period of the tenancy and the capacities of the parties entering into the agreement (whether a party to an agreement is an individual or a limited company, etc.), different formalities for execution may be required.\n\nWhile the terms ***\"Tenancy Agreement\"*** and ***\"Lease\"*** are often casually used as if they are synonyms in modern times and that both are generally binding, effective and enforceable in Court, there may still be some technical differences between them in their legal meaning.\n\n**[a) Period/length of the tenancy](https://www.clic.org.hk/en/topics/landlord_tenant/thingsYouNeedToNote/period_of_tenancy)**\n\n**[b) Capacities of the parties](https://www.clic.org.hk/en/topics/landlord_tenant/thingsYouNeedToNote/capacities_of_parties)**\n\n**[c) Implied covenants](https://www.clic.org.hk/en/topics/landlord_tenant/thingsYouNeedToNote/Implied_covenants)**\n\n**[d) Deed of Mutual Covenant](https://www.clic.org.hk/en/topics/landlord_tenant/thingsYouNeedToNote/deed_of_mutual_covenant)**\n\n**[e) Interests affecting the tenancy](https://www.clic.org.hk/en/topics/landlord_tenant/thingsYouNeedToNote/Interests_affecting_tenancy)**\n\n**[f) Tenancy without a written tenancy agreement](https://www.clic.org.hk/en/topics/landlord_tenant/thingsYouNeedToNote/tenancy_without_a_written_tenancy_agreement)**",

        "question": "What should a well-drafted lease or tenancy agreement include regarding rates, management fees, and other charges?",
        "answer": "A better drafted lease/tenancy agreement shall also deal with the issues as to whether the tenant shall be responsible for payment of management fees, rates, government rent or other charges (such as utilities and telecommunication services).\n\nIn the absence of any express provision in dealing with such matters, it may generally mean that the 'rent' payable by a tenant covers all existing or ongoing expenses of the unit to be borne by the landlord and the tenant may not be liable to pay anything further.\n\nTherefore, if the landlord so wishes, it would be a better practice to expressly set out under a lease/tenancy agreement as to the following areas:-\n\n1. Who shall be responsible for payment of rates, government rent, management fees and/or other charges;\n2. Whether the tenant shall open and/or maintain an account with the utility/service company themselves for the unit (e.g. water supplies department, drainage services department, sewage scavenger services (applicable to village houses), electricity, telephone, towngas, internet services andTV subscription) until the termination of the lease;\n3. Who shall be responsible for payment of any deposits and their return upon termination of the lease/tenancy agreement;\n4. When such payment shall be effected (i.e. pre-payment or when the fall due) and how tenant shall be given notice about the amount due;\n5. How such payment shall be made (i.e. directly to the payee (i.e. the Government, Management Office or utility company) and whether such payment obligation shall form (or be separated from) part of the rent;\n6. The consequences for non-payment of such fees/charges.\n\nIf existing utility account(s) are maintained by the landlord in respect of the unit, the landlord should make arrangements as to whether such accounts shall be transferred or replaced by another account under the tenant's name. The tenancy agreement should also state as to upon termination of the lease (1) how outstanding amount(s) due should be paid, such as deduction from the rental deposit; and (2) if the tenant has paid any 'deposit' to such accounts maintained by the landlord, when and how such deposit shall be returned.\n\nLandlords should note that, as the registered owner of the property, he/she remains to be primarily liable to the Government for any default on payment of government rent/rates.\n\nThe same also applies to management fees or other forms of contributions (e.g. renovation costs and contribution to litigation funds) to be made pursuant to the Deed of Mutual Covenant (\"DMC\") or the [Building Management Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/) ([Cap. 344](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/344/)) (the \"BMO\").\n\nNotwithstanding that a lease/tenancy agreement may provide that a tenant shall be liable to effect payment of management fees directly to the management office, such payment obligation is only privy between the landlord and tenant and is not binding on the manager or other co-owners. Moreover, since an obligation to pay money under the DMC/BMO is 'positive' in nature, by the effect of [section 41(5)](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s41.html) and [(6)](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s41.html) of the [Conveyancing and Property Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/) ([Cap. 219](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/)), it is prima facie not directly enforceable by the manager/incorporated owners against a tenant so that the landlord remains to be liable for any tenant's default on payments.",

        "question": "HOW TO RECOVER THE OUTSTANDING RENT AND GET BACK THE PROPERTY?",
        "answer": "A tenancy agreement may contain a clause that entitles the landlord to forfeit the tenancy (i.e. to terminate the tenancy and to re-enter the property) if the tenant fails to duly pay rent.\n\nEven if the tenancy document does not contain a forfeiture clause, the law generally implies such a ***right of forfeiture*** upon non-payment of rent.\n\nRegarding tenancies of ***domestic properties*** that were created on or after 27 December 2002, [section 117(3)](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/7/s117.html) of the [Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/7/) implies in such tenancies a covenant on the part of the tenant to pay the rent on the due date and a condition for forfeiture if that covenant is broken by virtue of non-payment of rent within 15 days of the due date.\n\nRegarding tenancies of ***non-domestic properties***, [section 126](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/7/s126.html) of the [Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/7/) provides that in the absence of any express covenant for the payment of rent and condition for forfeiture, there will be implied in every tenancy a covenant to pay the rent on the due date and a condition for forfeiture for non-payment within 15 days of that date.\n\nTherefore, in general, if a tenant is late in paying the rent for 15 days, the landlord is entitled to terminate the tenancy and obtain an order for possession from the Court (including the Lands Tribunal) to recover vacant possession of the property.\n\nHowever, if the non-payment takes place for the first time during the course of a tenancy, the tenant who wishes to \"save\" the tenancy has a right to do so by paying all of the outstanding rent and the landlord's legal costs in arrears at a specified time granted by the Court before the landlord could take possession of the property by the Court order. This is commonly known as \"relief against forfeiture\".",

        "answer": "Supposing that an existing tenancy is about to expire, the landlord and the tenant can commence negotiation on whether to renew the tenancy.\n\nFor tenancy agreements entered before 9th July 2004, a landlord was in most cases bound to renew a tenancy for a [domestic property](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/landlord_tenant/regulationsOnUsingOrOccupyingALeasedProperty/q1) with an existing tenant under the law. However, the law has changed. Tenancy agreements entered after such date no longer offers any statutory right of renewal in favor of a tenant. A tenant could only 'renew' his tenancy either through negotiation or contractually exercising an 'option to renew' under a tenancy agreement (if so provided).\n\nAn 'option to renew' clause in the contract usually requires the tenant to give a written notice to the landlord not later than a date specified in the contract. The clause may also contain reference to the terms of the new tenancy document, such as on the same terms as the existing tenancy or a slight increase in payable rent over the renewed term of tenancy.\n\nSubject to the agreement between the parties, an \"option to renew\" clause may look like this (for reference only):\n\n*\"It is hereby agreed that if the Tenant wishes to take a further term of two years from the expiration of the Term and at least six months prior to such expiration gives the Landlord written notice to that effect and has paid the rent and all monies hereby reserved and reasonably performed and observed the terms and conditions on its part herein contained up to the expiration of the Term, then the Landlord will let the Property to the Tenant for a further term of two years from such expiration at a new monthly rent and subject to the same terms and conditions as are herein contained except this clause for renewal.\"*",

        "answer": "For a tenant who fails to pay rent fully or partially, sometimes the tenancy agreement may contain an express clause which entitles the landlord to terminate (or 'forfeit') the tenancy agreement upon any extent of non-payment or late payment of rent.\n\nUnder sections [117](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s117.html) and [126](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s126.html) of the[ Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/) ([Cap.7](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/)), it is implied by law that non-payment of rent for more than 15 days of the due date would give rise to a right for the landlord to forfeit/terminate the tenancy agreement.\n\nAlternatively, a landlord may also accept repudiation and terminate a tenancy agreement upon persistent non-payment of rent of a tenant for many months or there is evidence to suggest that the tenant has absconded/abandoned the property for good.\n\nUpon termination/forfeiture of the lease, the landlord may claim for an order for possession of the property in Court (or the Lands Tribunal). If the tenant does not oppose such claim, such order would usually be made.\n\nHowever, a tenant whom defaulted in payment of rent for the first time may apply for a grace period and would usually be given a chance by the Court or the Lands Tribunal (i.e. once during the term of the tenancy agreement) to pay up for all outstanding rent and the landlord's legal costs at the time of hearing of the application or within a specified period after the possession order is made. This is commonly known as 'relief against forfeiture' (for non-payment of rent) which is governed under [section 21F](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/s21F.html) of the [High Court Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/)([Cap.4](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/4/)).\n\nIf 'relief against forfeiture' is granted to the tenant and he does pay up the in full all outstanding rent and the landlord's costs within the stipulated period as imposed by the Court, the term of the tenancy agreement will become 'resurrected' upon the tenant's compliance and be treated as continuing under its original terms as if there was no default on rental payment before. In such event, the tenancy will become 'revived' notwithstanding that this might be against the landlord's wishes.\n\nIt must be noted that 'relief against forfeiture' can only be granted as of right upon the application of the tenant for once the Court during the duration of the tenancy agreement. If there is a repeated instance of non-payment of rent, the Court would decline to grant any relief unless good reason is shown by the defaulting tenant.",

        "question": "How can tenancies be terminated for breaches of the tenant other than non-payment of rent?",
        "answer": "In the event that the tenant pays rent on time but commits serious breach(s) of the tenancy agreement (e.g. subletting, conducting illegal activities, causing nuisance, installation of illegal structures or causing enforcement actions by the Incorporated Owners), the landlord may wish to terminate the tenancy and find another replacement tenant.\n\nIn such case, it would be necessary for the landlord to rely on any forfeiture/termination clause as expressly provided under the tenancy agreement to put an end to the tenancy and claim possession from the tenant. If the tenancy agreement is silent on such matter, the landlord (for residential premises only) may only rely on [section 117(3)(d) to (h)](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s117.html) of the [Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/) ([Cap. 7](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/)) to exercise implied rights of forfeiture as a fallback. Note that the law does not imply such right to terminate the tenancy agreement for tenancy agreements other than residential tenancies.\n\nThe landlord who wishes to terminate the tenancy on such ground is also required to give prior written notice to the tenant by specifying the breach and require the tenant to remedy the breach (or compensation payable) before termination and/or claiming possession of the property against the tenant.\n\nWhen the claim for possession is heard before the Court, the Court has a discretion in deciding whether or not to grant 'relief against forfeiture' in favor of a tenant under [section 58](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s58.html) of the [Conveyancing and Property Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/)([Cap. 219](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/)) (i.e. continuation of the tenancy by the tenant who already ceased the breach and upon payment of all legal costs incurred by the landlord) by considering the seriousness of the breach, whether the breach was 'remediable' and/or whether any permanent damage/stigma was attached to the property.",

        "question": "What are the handover matters at expiry/termination of a lease?",
        "answer": "It is another common problem in Hong Kong that tenancy agreements do not explicitly provide for the conditions of the property to be handed over back to the landlord at the time of termination or expiry of the tenancy agreement. This often constitutes a source of litigation between parties as to whether and to what extent a tenant shall be obliged to incur costs in restoring the property back to the 'original' state.\n\nGenerally, a tenant is under no obligation to 'improve' the property into a better state than what was given to him at the commencement of the tenancy. It is also expected that the property may suffer from fair wear and tear as result of aging and normal use in which the landlord may have to reasonably accept at the time of handover.\n\nIt is common for tenancy agreements to list out the 'landlord's fixtures' that the tenant shall be 'handed back' to the landlord at handover of the property at a reasonable status or replacements at equivalent value after depreciation (e.g. air-conditioners, electrical/cooking/heating appliances, bathing and sanitary fittings, built-in closets, doors and windows etc.).\n\nFor renovations carried out by the tenant within the property, it is a more complicated matter as to whether the landlord would be willing to accept delivery up of the property with such state given that renovations are often a matter of personal preference.\n\nFor commercial premises, it is often common for tenancy agreements to include an express obligation to delivery up of premises at a 'bare-shell' state to the reasonable satisfaction of the landlord (i.e. removal of all fixtures, including electrical/drainage appliances, ceilings, ground layers, sanitary fittings and fire-service installations, and leaving behind only the plastering/concrete surfaces).\n\nThere is no definitive indicator as to what constitutes 'reasonable satisfaction of the landlord' (which denotes a rather subjective and arbitrary standard). The duty to deliver up a 'bare-shell' is often an onerous and costly obligation for tenants to comply with. A tenant must quit earlier to allow sufficient time for restoration works to take place.\n\nIn practice, to avoid unnecessary disputes, it is often desirable for both parties to sign on a written acknowledgement about the state of handover of the property after inspection.",

        "answer": "If a tenant fails to pay rent, then the following measures are usually available to the landlord.\n\n \n\n**a) Action for the recovery of outstanding rent**\n\n \n\nIf landlords intend only to recover the outstanding rent but not to regain possession of the properties, then they may make their claim for rent arrears at one of the followings.\n\n \n\n The [Small Claims Tribunal](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/sc.html): for claims of $75,000 or less (To get more information about how to prepare for the trial (from both the Claimant's and the Defendant's perspective), please click [here](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/consumer_complaints/channels_for_consumer_complaints/q2); \n The [District Court](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/dc.html): for claims that exceed $75,000 but do not exceed $3,000,000;\n The [Court of First Instance of the High Court](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/hc.html), which has unlimited jurisdiction.\n\n \n\nLandlords of domestic properties [domestic property](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/landlord_tenant/regulationsOnUsingOrOccupyingALeasedProperty/q1), should ensure that they have submitted a [Notice of New Letting or Renewal Agreement (Form CR109)](http://www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/cr109.pdf) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation for endorsement within one month of the execution of the tenancy document. Landlords of domestic properties are not entitled to maintain legal action to recover rent under tenancy documents if the Commissioner does not endorse the form. However, landlords who do not submit the form within the one month period can do so at any time after paying a fee of $310.\n\n \n\n**b) Action for forfeiture (to get back the property) and to recover outstanding rent**\n\n \n\nIn the case of serious default on payment of rent or in the event that landlords believe that their tenants have been absconded or will not be able to pay the rent for the remaining term of the tenancy, then they will probably want to get back the property and recover the rent in arrears. In such circumstances, the landlords are said to be exercising their [right of forfeiture](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/landlord_tenant/failureToPayRent/) and may file their claims at:\n\n \n\n the [Lands Tribunal](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/lands.html); \n the [District Court](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/dc.html) if the outstanding rent does not exceed $3,000,000 and the rateable value of the property does not exceed $320,000; or\n the [Court of First Instance of the High Court](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/hc.html) for outstanding rent of any amount.\n\n \n\nThe landlord, if successful in obtaining a judgment against the tenant, will be able to apply to the tribunal/appropriate court for a ***Writ of Possession**. Upon the issue of the Writ of Possession, the [court bailiff](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/bailiff.html) will recover the possession of the property on the landlord’s behalf.\n\n \n\n***Jurisdiction of the High Court***\n\n \n\nIt should be noted that although the High Court has unlimited jurisdiction to handle any of the above claims, it normally will not entertain a claim that falls within the jurisdiction of the District Court or the Lands Tribunal.\n\n \n\n***Application for Summary Judgment for possession/Interim payment***\n\n \n\nAfter commencement of proceedings, it may take some time to wait for trial to take place at Court (especially for the District Court/Court of First Instance). However, for many cases, there may be procedure for landlords to recover possession/rent in a more speedy fashion known as “summary judgment” or “interim payment” if the landlord is satisfied that there is no arguable defence on the part of the tenant to resist an application for an order of repossession and/or payment of outstanding rent.\n\n \n\nYou must seek legal advice on any grounds for obtaining a summary judgment or an interim payment before you make the relevant application to court.\n\n \n\n**c) Action for distress**\n\n \n\nDistress means the seizure, detention and sale of movable chattels/goods found in the rented property to satisfy the rent arrears pursuant to a warrant issued by the District Court upon application by the landlord. Due to the nature of distress, it is mostly used in cases in which a tenant is still operating a business at the rented property. Part III of the [Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/7/) governs the procedures and formalities for applications for distress.\n\n \n\nThe application for distress is an ex-parte application (by one party only) to the District Court, meaning that the tenant will not have the chance to appear before the judge to make any submission (or objection). This is to avoid the tenant knowing of the application and dissipating the available assets.\n\n \n\nThe landlord must file an [affidavit/affirmation](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial/q2) to support the application in a prescribed form. If the Court accepts the landlord's application, then a warrant of distress is issued. The bailiff then enters the property, seizes the movable chattels/goods found inside and in the apparent possession of the tenant, and sells the chattels/goods to satisfy the rent in arrears.\n\n \n\nNote that the bailiff cannot seize land fixtures (e.g. air-conditioning machines and, some built-in appliances), things in use, tools and implements or the goods which is apparently owned by parties other than the tenant. The goods as seized will be impounded by the bailiff until the rent is paid or being sold by an auctioneer as the Court may direct.\n\n \n\nAs distress is complicated both in terms of procedures and legality, it is usually done with the assistance of legal professionals.",

        "answer": "It must be borne in mind that if the property is still being occupied by the tenant (or some other occupants), any forcible entry by the landlord into the Property without obtaining any court order may amount to criminal offence under [section 23](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/245/s23.html) of the [Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245)](http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/245/).\n\n \n\nThe landlord may also face other criminal charges such as ‘harassment’. [Section 119V](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/7/s119v.html) of the [Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/7/) (Cap. 7) expressly provides that any person who unlawfully deprives a tenant of occupation of the relevant premises commits an offence and may be liable to a fine or even imprisonment.\n\n \n\nA tenancy document will usually contain a clause that allows the landlord to re-enter the property if the tenant fails to pay rent. In the event that the landlord is sure that the tenant has deserted and abandoned the property in a vacant state (or only with inexpensive belongings left behind) for a reasonably long time, the law may recognize a right for the landlord treat the tenancy as terminated and quietly re-enter the premises by himself without resorting to court proceedings (i.e. self-help). For some owners in Hong Kong, this might be a convenient and inexpensive way to recover possession against absconding tenants.\n\n \n\nHowever, it is generally unsafe for the landlord to rely solely on such method and re-enter the property by self-help. There is always a risk that the tenant may reappear a few months later and allege that the landlord has wrongfully re-entered into the property or that valuables left in the property became misappropriated.\n\n \n\nTherefore, even if it may be quite certain that the tenant has deserted the property, the landlord should go through the [appropriate legal procedures](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/landlord_tenant/failureToPayRent/q1), which will eventually lead to the recovery of the property with the assistance of the bailiff.",

        "answer": "Shortly speaking, the issue generally depends on whether the obligation to pay rent was dependent on the fulfillment of any obligations on the part of the landlord (e.g. repair or quiet enjoyment, if so agreed) and/or whether the tenancy agreement expressly allowed the tenant to 'deduct' any rent payable by any reason.\n\n \n\nIn most situations and in the absence of any special clauses under the tenancy agreement, the tenant's obligation to pay rent is *independent* of other obligations to be performed by the landlord. Simply put, no 'rent' is likely to become 'deductible' or 'set-off' as such even if the allegation of the tenant may appear to be true.\n\n \n\nThis is to say, the complaints by a tenant over the standard/quality/condition of living in the property is unlikely to constitute a sound legal defence to non-payment of rent. As explained, non-payment of rent alone would enable the landlord to exercise his/her right to claim for outstanding rent and even forfeit the tenancy (subject to relief against forfeiture exercisable by the tenant).\n\n \n\nThe above is only a preliminary analysis of general propositions of the law and whether such principle is applicable to all cases would be heavily dependent on the terms of the tenancy agreement and exact individual circumstances.

This in effect limits the landlord’s right to recover unpaid rent for up to a maximum of 12 months.\n\nLast revision date:\n\n \n\n18 October, 2022",

But this is not desirable and may lead to unnecessary complications in practice.\n\n \n\nA lease for a term not exceeding 3 years at market rent which takes effect in possession may be created orally by virtue of section 6(2) of the Conveyancing and Property Ordinance (Cap. 219).\n\n \n\nFor leases which do not fall under the above exception, whilst in general they are legally binding as between the landlord and the tenant, problems may arise if the parties need to take legal action to resolve disputes relating to the tenancy. This is because section 3(1) of the Conveyancing and Property Ordinance (Cap. 219) states that no legal action may be brought on an oral agreement for lease, unless:-\n(a)   there is some memorandum or note in writing evidencing the tenancy agreement and signed by the parties; or\n(b)   the parties can rely on the doctrine of part performance by demonstrating that they have performed sufficient acts pursuant to the oral agreement between them.\n\n \n\nBy way of example, upon entering into an oral tenancy agreement with the landlord, the tenant has already moved into the flat and has duly paid rent to the landlord periodically, then the tenant may be able to invoke the doctrine of part performance to assert that there has been an oral tenancy agreement between the parties.\n\nLast revision date:\n\n \n\n18 October, 2022",

        "answer": "This example is likely to be a tenancy for a fixed term with an option to renew and a break clause allowing either the landlord or the tenant to early terminate the tenancy agreement by one-month notice during the currency of the term.\n\n \n\nAn option to renew typically provides that the tenant would be entitled to take a further term of the tenancy if the tenant gives prior written notice to that effect to the landlord at least a specified period before the expiration of the original tenancy and on the condition that the tenant has reasonably performed and observed the terms and obligations during the original tenancy. \n\n \n\nIn order for the option to renew to be binding upon the successor(s)-in-title of the landlord (e.g. the succeeding owner of the property), the tenancy agreement in writing has to be duly registered in the Land Registry in accordance with section 3(1) of the Land Registration Ordinance (Cap. 128).\n\n \n\nThe landlord should be conscious that whether to exercise the option to renew is largely a choice for the tenant.

        "answer": "The implied covenant on the landlord that the premises is fit for habitation only applies to furnished tenancy and only at the commencement of the tenancy. Such covenant does not last throughout the life of the tenancy.\n\n \n\nSo where the water tap is broken during the currency of the tenancy, the landlord is unlikely to be in breach of the covenant as to habitability.\n\n \n\nIn fact, whether the obligation to repair the broken water tap falls on the landlord or the tenant or neither of them is to be determined by reference to the specific provisions of the tenancy agreement.\n\nLast revision date:\n\n \n\n18 October, 2022",

A GAP OF ABOUT 2CM) UPON THE COLLECTION OF KEYS FROM THE ESTATE AGENT. GIVEN THAT I HAVE ALREADY SIGNED THE FORMAL TENANCY AGREEMENT AND I AM PREPARING TO MOVE IN, IS IT REASONABLE FOR ME TO REQUEST THE LANDLORD TO REPAIR IT? IN CONTRAST, THE LANDLORD WANTED TO AMEND THE AGREEMENT TO INCLUDE A NEW CLAUSE REQUIRING US TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS DEFECT WITH A PHOTO. IS IT LAWFUL?",
        "answer": "Whether the landlord is an obligation to carry out repairs depends primarily on the terms of the tenancy agreement. Some tenancy agreements may state that the tenant is solely responsible for the repair of doors, windows, etc. during the continuance of the tenancy. \n\n \n\nIf the defect is not substantial enough to affect the normal use and enjoyment of the flat, it is rather unlikely that the tenant could terminate the tenancy agreement on such ground.\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, assuming that the parties have already entered into a legally binding tenancy agreement, in principle, the tenant is not obliged to agree to an addition or amendment of the terms of the tenancy agreement.\n\n \n\nPragmatically, when faced with the above situation, the tenant should inform and liaise with the landlord and endeavour to solve the problem amicably.\n\n \n\nIt is advisable for a prospective tenant to arrange for an inspection of the subject property in the presence of the estate agent before committing to a tenancy agreement. If any noticeable defect is detected at the commencement of the tenancy, it should be documented properly to avoid potential dispute between the parties in the future.\n\nLast revision date:\n\n \n\n18 October, 2022",

THE LANDLORD LATER EVICTED ME FROM THE PROPERTY. CAN I GO TO THE COURT TO ENFORCE THE TENANCY AGREEMENT AND SEEK REMEDIES?",
        "answer": "Entering into such kind of tenancy arrangements is not advisable and is very risky, especially to the tenant.\n\nPresumably it has been written in the tenancy agreement that the subject property is for industrial use only. It is not hard to imagine when dispute emerges, the landlord is all the more tempted to deny the existence of the alleged understanding that the property would be used for residential purpose. If the tenant cannot prove on evidence that there was such an understanding, the tenant, instead of the landlord, would, on the face of it, be the party in breach of the user restriction in the tenancy agreement and naturally would unlikely be entitled to any remedies.\n\nEven if the tenant manages to establish the understanding with the landlord at the outset, it is very doubtful whether the court would specifically enforce a tenancy agreement which is in breach of the user restriction of the property.\n\nSeparately, the landlord and the tenant are most likely in breach of the deed of mutual covenant of the building for allowing the property to be used for non-industrial purposes. Both of them may be liable in legal action by the management company, the incorporated owners (if any) or other owners of the building.",

        "answer": "It depends on whether the option to renew has been duly registered in the Land Registry.\n\nAn option to renew in a written tenancy agreement is an interest in land registrable in the Land Registry under section 3(1) of the Land Registration Ordinance (Cap. 128), irrespective of whether the tenancy is for a term not exceeding 3 years.\n\nNon-registration of registrable instrument is rendered absolutely null and void to all intents and purposes as against any subsequent *bona fide* purchaser for valuable consideration of the same property, regardless of whether the purchaser has notice of the option to renew or not.\n\nSo if the written tenancy agreement containing the option to renew has not been duly registered in the Land Registry, it is not binding on a subsequent *bona fide* purchaser for value.\n\nIn contrast, if the tenancy agreement has been so registered, the option to renew takes priority and the new landlord is not entitled to refuse if the tenant chooses to exercise the option to renew.",

        "answer": "The computation of the notice period shall be based on the terms of tenancy agreement.\n\nIf the tenancy is for a fixed term with no break clause, neither the landlord nor the tenant has the right to early terminate the tenancy. The term of the tenancy expires automatically by effluxion of time. It is not necessary to give notice to quit.\n\nIf the tenancy agreement has a break clause allowing either the landlord or the tenant to give notice to terminate earlier than the end of the term, then the date when the notice is served is normally excluded when calculating the notice period.\n\nIn the case of a yearly tenancy, the common law rule is that it can be terminated by at least a half year’s notice expiring at the end of a yearly period, unless the parties have otherwise agreed.\n\nFor other periodic tenancies, that is, a weekly, monthly or quarterly tenancy, the general rule is the notice period is the same as one full period of the tenancy, unless the parties have otherwise agreed.\n\nThe notice to quit shall, unless the contrary intention is expressed, be in writing and must be served in the form and manner prescribed in [section 62](https://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s62.html) of the [Conveyancing and Property Ordinance](https://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/219) ([Cap. 219](https://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/legis/ord/219)).",

        "answer": "Whether or not the tenant can do so would depend on whether any breach by the landlord of its covenants in the tenancy agreement so as to entitle the tenant to early terminate the tenancy.\n\nThe landlord’s usual covenant for quiet enjoyment cannot assist the tenant, unless, very exceptionally, the neighbouring premises is also owned by the same landlord and it can be shown that the excessive noise caused by the occupant is authorised by the landlord. The covenant for quiet enjoyment does not offer absolute protection against all forms of interference by any person during the tenancy, but only protects the tenant against interference with quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the premises by the landlord or persons deriving title from the landlord.\n\nThe remedies available to the tenant may be an injunctive relief prohibiting the neighbour from causing or permitting nuisance and a claim for monetary damages against the neighbour resulting from breach of the deed of mutual covenants or nuisance.\n\nOf course, if the tenancy agreement has a break clause, the tenant may also rely on the break clause and early terminate the tenancy accordingly.",

        "answer": "Not every breach of the tenancy agreement would entitle the innocent party to terminate the tenancy early. Whether the tenant in this example can terminate the tenancy agreement depends on whether the removal of the balcony was serious enough to constitute a repudiatory breach of the agreement on the part of the landlord so as to allow the tenant to elect to accept the repudiation and terminate the tenancy.\n\nThe landlord expressly or impliedly covenants not to derogate from its grant. That means the landlord cannot do any act so as to defeat the purpose for which the lease was granted to the tenant.\n\nEach case must turn on its own facts. It is very unlikely though the flat was rented for the main purpose of using the balcony. The occupation and use of the flat should remain largely unaffected. In the circumstances, it seems unlikely that the landlord has breached its covenant not to derogate from the grant so as to entitle the tenant to terminate the tenancy agreement.",

        "answer": "It is rather common for a tenancy agreement to provide that the tenant shall deliver up possession of the premises upon the termination of the tenancy in a condition “to the reasonable satisfaction of the landlord” (with fair wear and tear excepted).\n\nIn law, there is no standard or determinative answer for what is meant by “reasonable satisfaction of the landlord” in this context. The landlord and the tenant should, and certainly would the Court, exercise a degree of reasonableness and common sense in assessing whether the tenant is at fault. Bearing in mind that the tenancy has already come to an end, the parties should carefully consider whether it is worthwhile and economically efficient to incur time and costs to dispute how much is to be deducted from the rental deposit.\n\nIn the absence of terms in the tenancy agreement stipulating the mechanism on how to resolve the differences, the tenant may have to resort to legal action to recover the rental deposit from the landlord in the case that negotiations between the parties fail.",

Depending on the terms of the tenancy agreement, the landlord may be entitled to forfeit the rental deposit in full or in part if the tenant fails to pay the rent or other sum due under the tenancy agreement, or if the landlord has suffered any damage due to the failure by the tenant to perform its covenant.\n\nIf the landlord has unreasonably refused to return the rental deposit, and the parties fail to reach consensus by negotiation, the tenant may need to commence legal action to recover the rental deposit from the landlord.\n\nThe proper venue for the litigation would depend on the amount in dispute:-\n(a)   Small Claims Tribunal — where the claim is for HK$75,000 or less;\n(b)   District Court — where the claim exceeds HK$75,000 but do not exceed HK$3,000,000; or\n(c)   Court of First Instance, for any claim exceeding HK$3,000,000.",

Where a tenant holds over with the landlord’s consent, express or implied, at the end of a fixed-term tenancy and either party may at any time terminate the arrangement at will, it is a tenancy at will.

Even if a tenancy purports to be a tenancy for a term other than 2 years, the term of the tenancy is taken to be 2 years (see [Section 120AAQ](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s120AAQ.html));\n- **Break clause for the landlord**: Any break clause allowing a landlord to terminate the tenancy early is void and has no effect (see [Section 120AAQ](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s120AAQ.html));\n- **Break clause for the tenant**: Any break clause allowing a tenant to terminate the tenancy at a predetermined date later than the first day of the second year of the term, or the absence of a break clause for the tenant, will be taken as having one allowing the tenant to terminate the tenancy on the first day of the second year of the term with a notice period of 30 days (see [Section AAZH](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s120AAZH.html));\n- **Landlord’s right of re-entry**: Any condition for forfeiture (other than those set out in Part 4 of [Schedule 7](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/sch7.html)) provided in the tenancy is void and has no effect (see[ Section 120AAZF](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s120AAZF.html), Part 4 of [Schedule 7](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/sch7.html));\n- **Amount of r****ental deposit**: The rental deposit payable by the tenant may not be more than 2 months’ rent under the tenancy (see [Section 120AAZC(2)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s120AAZC.html));\n- **Return of rental deposit**: The rental deposit should be returned, free of interest, no later than the expiry of 7 days after the tenant’s delivery of vacant possession of the subdivided unit to the landlord (see [Section 120AAZC(4)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s120AAZC.html));\n- **Repair and maintenance responsibilities**: The repair and maintenance responsibilities of the facilities and fixtures set out in Part 2 of [Schedule 7](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/sch7.html) are to be borne by the landlord (see Section 5 of [Schedule 7](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/sch7.html));\n- **Payment of money of certain types**: The landlord cannot require the tenant to pay any money in relation to the tenancy other than specified items (see Section [120AAZL](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s120AAZL.html));\n- **Payment for specified utilities and services**: The landlord cannot require the tenant to pay for reimbursement of utility and service charges as a separate payment from the rent, where the aggregation of the amount exceeds the amount under the bills issued by the relevant authorities (see [Section 120AAZM](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/s120AAZM.html));\n- **Stamp duty**: The stamp duty on the tenancy agreement is to be borne by the landlord solely. It is the responsibility of the landlord to arrange for the stamping of the agreement under the [Stamp Duty Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/117/) ([ 117](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/117/)) (see Section 2 of [Schedule 7](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/sch7.html)).\n\nIf the landlord enforces the tenancy terms that are inconsistent or in conflict with those of mandatory terms in a regulated tenancy, depending on the terms, in addition to the potential liability for criminal offences (e.g., overcharging for reimbursement of utility and service charges), the resulting disputes may also be resolved in civil proceedings. Tenancy terms that are inconsistent with mandatory terms stipulated in the [Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/) ([Cap. 7](https://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/legis/ord/7/)) will be deemed void or equivalent to the relevant terms stipulated in the Ordinance.",

The landlord is liable on a first conviction to a fine at level 3 (currently HK$10,000), and on a second or subsequent conviction to a fine at level 4 (currently HK$25,000).\n\nA landlord who fraudulently alters the meter to overcharge the utility fees for a sub-divided unit may commit further criminal offences.",

        "answer": "**Electricity**\n\nOn electricity supply, the power companies will install individual meters for customers if prior consent from landlords and building management has been obtained, and that the units concerned comply with the relevant prerequisites and safety standards such as the installation of an individual door, and that the separate electrical installations and other facilities can meet the safety standards stipulated in the [Electricity Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/406/) ([Cap. 406](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/406/)) and requirements of the Supply Rules of the power companies.\n\nIf the rental premises are sub-divided units equipped with electrical installations and separate meters, landlords' consent will be required to modify the existing electrical installations to meet the safety standards stipulated in the [Electricity Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/406/) and the requirements of the Supply Rules before individual meters can be installed.\n\nIn addition, meters must be connected to the riser which supplies electricity in a building and be installed in the common areas to facilitate meter reading by the staff of the power companies. Therefore, before applying for individual meters, tenants of sub-divided units should identify suitable locations in the common areas of the buildings for installing meters and obtain the consent of building management for the allocation of space for meter installation.\n\nThe Hongkong Electric has launched an SDU (subdivided unit) Rewiring Subsidy Programme subsidizing eligible households in subdivided units to rewire and install individual tariff meters. The applicant shall obtain the prior consent of every household in the flat, the owner of the flat and the Building Owners’ Corporations. Meanwhile, the CLP Power has released a similar scheme for owners as applicants. For details, please visit their websites:\n[Hongkong Electric SDU Rewiring Subsidy Scheme](https://www.hkelectric.com/en/smart-power/community-care/sdu-rewiring-subsidy)\n[CLP Power Rewiring Works for Subdivided Units](https://www.clp.com.hk/en/community/Rewiring)\n\n**Water**\n\nAs regards installation of water meters, if the relevant unit has a proper postal address to ensure that letters from the Water Supplies Department (WSD) such as notices and water bills can be posted to the occupier, the occupier may apply for a separate water meter from the WSD. The following factors will also be taken into account by the WSD when processing the applications:\n- Whether the premises can be accessed without passing through any area occupied by others to ensure that the Water Authority can enter the premises directly for inspection or carrying out other relevant duties in case of any problem of the inside service;\n- Whether the premises have proper drainage systems to ensure that no flooding will occur in case of inside service fault; and\n- Whether the application satisfies the requirements of the Waterworks Ordinance. For example, the applicant is required to accept responsibility for the custody and maintenance of inside service, and submit the plumbing proposal in respect of the inside service etc.\n\nLandlords or tenants may also consider applying to the WSD for the installation of separate water meters for sub-divided units to enable tenants to pay water charges based on their water consumption.\n\nFor subdivided units which have separate plumbing systems for individual units installed, the landlord can apply for a pilot scheme with streamlined procedures to facilitate the installation of the WSD’s water meter. After approval, water supplied to individual subdivided units will be charged according to the schedule for domestic consumers as stipulated in the Waterworks Regulations.

Once the tenancy agreement is entered into, both parties are required to abide by the relevant terms and conditions.

        "question": "If I have found that my tenant has sub-let my property to some other person without my consent, then what can I do to protect my interests?",
        "answer": "To prohibit a tenant from sub-letting, it is necessary for a tenancy document to provide for an *express* clause that prohibits the tenant from subletting the property (or any part of it) to another party. It is also common practice of landlords to extend the prohibition against any act of licensing or sharing/parting of possession or occupation of the property.\n\nIf the tenancy document does not contain a clause that restrains a tenant from subletting, then the mere act of subletting of the unit (or part of it) to another person, even without the landlord’s consent, may not be illegal *per se* (subject to whether the tenant’s sub-letting has contravened any government regulations as explained above). As a tenancy has the effect of passing the landlord’s interests in the property to the tenant during the tenancy period, the tenant may deal with the property in whatever manner as if he owns the property (except for any illegal activities or actions which would amount to a breach of the tenancy agreement), including subletting the property to another party.\n\nBased on the same reasoning, the breach of a prohibition clause on subletting may make the tenant liable to the landlord for injunction and/or damages. In certain cases, it may also enable the landlord to forfeit the tenancy agreement upon such breach.\n\nIn practice, even if a covenant against sub-letting is in force and without any other kinds of restriction, a tenant is still at liberty to *cohabit, share occupation* or use the property with other parties (who are often claimed to be guests, relatives or friends of the tenant). Prima facie, they do not fall within the ambit of ‘sub-letting’.\n\nIn the absence of any direct evidence that the tenant is engaging in sub-letting activities of the premises (e.g. copies of signed sub-leases, further partitions being made, admissions made by occupants, advertisements/ invitations made by tenant and excessive consumption of utilities), it is often difficult in practice for the landlord to prove and enforce restrictive covenants against sub-letting.",

        "answer": "If the superior landlord rightly forfeits the head lease agreement upon such breach, it may have the effect of destroying any sub-lease created out of it.\n\nWhere the head lease is forfeited, a sub-tenant can apply for “relief against forfeiture” from the Court of First Instance under [section 58(4)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/s58.html) of [Conveyancing and Property Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/) ([Cap. 219](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/219/)) for a ‘vesting order’ for the subdivided unit occupied by the sub-tenant. The order vests the remaining term (or any less term) of the head lease to the sub-tenant with conditions that may be imposed by the Court (e.g., payment of rent) (see “[Subletting](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/landlord_tenant/sub_letting)”).\n\nAlternatively, the sub-tenant may need to vacate the premises and bring an action against the sub-landlord granting such sub-lease for relief against the breach of the sub-lease.",

The customary discount in this condition is likely between 10% and 25%. Generally, it is not necessary for the Court to specify the relative amounts or proportions of the drugs for self-consumption save in very broad terms.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeal has emphasised that a bare assertion is insufficient. The defendant must provide some reliable material or evidence to establish to the Court's satisfaction that part of the dangerous drugs is intended for self-consumption.

        "question": "When and how can the executor/administrator remove the items inside the deceased's safe deposit box at a bank?",
        "answer": "**Solely rented safe deposit box**\n\nAfter the taking of inventory, any removal of documents from the box before a Grant of Representation must be authorised by the Home Affairs Department (details can be found on the website of the Home Affairs Department - [Estate Beneficiaries Support Unit](http://www.had.gov.hk/en/public_services/estates/deposit_box.htm#s9)) . Generally speaking, only documents relevant to an application for a Grant of Representation, or personal items relating to a person other than the deceased and urgently required by that person, can be removed. Documents and articles of value will not generally be permitted to be removed.\n\n**Jointly rented safe deposit box**\n\nIf the jointly rented safe deposit box has a survivorship agreement with the bank, after the inventory has been prepared, the surviving renter (if he is the executor/administrator or has obtained the written consent of that executor/administrator) can apply to the [Home Affairs Department](http://www.had.gov.hk/en/public_services/estates/deposit_box.htm#s11) for authorisation to remove the contents of the safe deposit box. However, the surviving renter will be able to remove all contents of the safe deposit box without authorisation from the Home Affairs Department after 12 month from the date of death of the deceased.",

        "question": "The allocation of estate has been clearly set out in a Will. Can this prevent all the disputes which may come out during the distribution process?",
        "answer": "One of the main functions of a Will is to provide instructions for distributing the estate according to the intention of the testator (person making the Will, i.e. the deceased). Even if the intention of the testator is clearly stated in the Will, it may still be challenged.\n\nFor example, someone who could be a beneficiary under intestacy, or who is not satisfied with his share of the estate under the deceased's Will, could claim that the Will is invalid on the basis that the deceased did not have the mental capacity to make the Will, or was unduly influenced by a third party in making the Will. Any aggrieved party may bring legal action against the executor to contest the validity of the deceased's Will.\n\nA man could have made a Will that left everything to his legitimate children with no provision for his surviving wife or illegitimate child whom he had been maintaining before his death. Under such circumstances, the surviving spouse could make a claim for a share of the estate, and the illegitimate child could claim for maintenance to be provided for him out of the estate pursuant to the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Ordinance. Whilst the law in Hong Kong confers absolute testamentary freedom on individuals, it also recognizes the need for an individual to make financial provisions from his estate for his spouse and those who had been dependent on him financially during his lifetime. For more details on the matter, please refer to [the relevant question and answer](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/probate/making_a_will/q3).\n\nTo a lesser extent, other practical difficulties may arise. An old lady stated in her Will that her diamond necklace is to be left to her granddaughter. This necklace could not be found in the old lady's home or safe deposit box after her death. Usually the executor is a member of the family or a close and trusted friend of the whole family. How can this executor balance his/her duty to make the requisite inquiries on behalf of the granddaughter and yet maintain a harmonious relationship with the deceased's other family members?\n\nAn executor who does not wish to prove the Will personally for whatever reason (e.g. awkward family relationships or time constraints), could appoint a Hong Kong registered trust company to take out a Grant of Representation on his/her behalf, subject to the consent of the beneficiaries of the Will.",

        "question": "If the deceased made no will, how can the relevant estate be distributed?",
        "answer": "The order of priority under the law relating to the entitlement of the deceased's estate is similar to the order relating to the eligibility to apply for a Grant of Letters of Administration (please refer to [the relevant question and answer](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/probate/preliminary_issues/q1)).\n\nIn reality, it often happens that 2 or more parties who are entitled to the assets survive and may claim the deceased's estate together. The followings are some of the usual scenarios. For details, please refer to [section 4](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/73/s4) of the [Intestates' Estates Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/73).\n\n**(A) The deceased only leaves a spouse**\n\nIf the deceased leaves a spouse, but leaves no issue, parent, brother or sister of the whole blood (the same parents), or issue of a brother or sister of the whole blood, then the surviving husband or wife is absolutely entitled to the **residuary estate** (i.e. the whole sum after deduction of the deceased's debts, taxes, funeral, legal and administration expenses from the estate).\n\n(Note: **\"Issue\"** has a special meaning in the succession law which is different from the daily usage. It means any descendants of a person.)\n\n**(B) The deceased leaves a spouse and issue**\n\nIf the deceased leaves a spouse and issue, whether or not survived by his/her parents or siblings, the surviving spouse could take the following first:\n\n1. all of the deceased's [personal chattels](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary#p);\n2. a sum of $500,000 from the residuary estate.\n\nAfter the aforesaid $500,000 is paid out, if there is any remaining sum, it would be divided in half. One half will be distributed to the surviving spouse and the other half will be divided equally amongst the child/children of the deceased.\n\n**(C) The deceased leaves a spouse, parents and siblings, but no issue**\n\nIf the deceased has issue, the deceased's parents, brothers and sisters cannot obtain anything even if the deceased's spouse has predeceased (die before) the deceased.\n\nOnly if the deceased has **no** **issue** can the parents and siblings have a share in the deceased's estate, **even if his/her spouse survives** . The surviving spouse could take the following first:\n\n1. all of the deceased's [personal chattels](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary#p);\n2. a sum of $1,000,000 from the residuary estate.\n\nAfter the aforesaid $1,000,000 is paid out, if there is any remaining sum, it would be divided in half. One half will be distributed to the surviving spouse and the other half will be distributed to the surviving parent(s).\n\nOn the other hand, if one or both parents survive, the siblings cannot obtain a share of the deceased's estate. They will only be entitled to part of the estate (after deduction of the spouse's entitlement) if the deceased leaves no issue and no parents.\n\n**(D) The deceased leaves issue, but no spouse**\n\nIf the deceased has issue but no surviving spouse, the residuary estate will be distributed to the issue in accordance with the following rules:\n\nIf the deceased's children all survived him/her, the residuary estate will be divided equally among them, and the grandchildren will not receive any portion of the estate.\n\nHowever, if a child has predeceased the deceased and leaves behind child(ren) of his/her own, the child(ren) of that predeceased child will take up the share that would have been given to that predeceased child (if more than one, divided on an equal basis).\n\nIn the event that a child has predeceased the deceased without leaving any child(ren) of his/her own and the deceased has more than one surviving child, the predeceased child's share of the estate will be equally divided among other surviving children.\n\n**(E) The share of \"illegitimate children\"**\n\nAn illegitimate child means a child whose natural parents are not married in a manner that the laws of Hong Kong recognize. For details of legal marriage, please go to the topic of [\"Matrimonial Matters\"](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/familyMatrimonialAndCohabitation/divorce/precondition/q4).\n\nBefore the 19th June 1993, illegitimate children were not entitled to succeed to their deceased father's estate if their father died intestate (without a Will). Illegitimate children could succeed to their mother's estate on her intestacy, but only when there were no surviving legitimate children. If the deceased parent had a Will and he gave \"his children\" a gift or a sum of money to share, the illegitimate children were not entitled to share in the gift.\n\nHowever, this position has been changed by the [Parent and Child Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/429). Illegitimate children can now enjoy the same succession rights as legitimate ones if their parents **die after 19 th June 1993** .\n\nOne point to note is that for those adopted children (i.e. they have been adopted by persons through a legal adoption process), they have the same status as the natural children. In other words, they shall be treated as the children of the adopter but not the children of any other persons.\n\nFor more information regarding the distribution of estate, please go to the [\"case illustration\"](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/probate/Inheritance_families_and_dependants_ordinance/case_illustration).",

        "question": "How does one avoid intermeddling of the estate (handling the estate without permission) after abolition of the estate duty?",
        "answer": "Before the abolition of estate duty, as the Applicant needs to obtain estate duty clearance before filing the application for a Grant with the Probate Registry, the Inland Revenue Department acted as the gate keeper to prevent possible intermeddling of the deceased's estate.\n\nAfter the abolition of estate duty, provisions have been made in the laws of Hong Kong to safeguard against intermeddling of an estate. These provisions will be similar to those used in the estate duty era:\n- Intermeddling of the deceased's estate is an offence;\n- A person would be liable to a fine of $10,000 plus and additional penalty equal to the value of the assets intermeddled if:\n  that person intermeddles the estate or the income therefrom and either fails to file an application for [summary administration](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/probate/estate_duty_and_grant_of_representation/q4) (for cases where the value of the estate does not exceed $150,000) or fails to file an application for a Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration within 12 months from the death of the deceased; OR that person intermeddles with the estate after the 12-month's period without a Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration or summary administration.\n\nFor more information on this matter, you can go to the [Home Affairs Bureau's webpage](https://www.had.gov.hk/en/public_services/estates/intermeddling.htm).",

        "question": "What are the advantages of making a Will?",
        "answer": "Any person over the age of 18 may make a Will. A Will is a document which sets out how a person's assets are to be distributed after his or her death. The person making the Will is called the \"testator\"(if male) or \"testatrix\"(if female). Therefore, if a person leaves a Will after the death, he or she is said to have died \"testate\". For those without a Will, they are called \"intestate\".\n\nIf a person makes a Will, he/she can:\n1. arrange how his/her assets will be shared amongst relatives other than according to the law of intestate;\n2. leave assets to beneficiaries who are not related to him/her, e.g. friends and charities;\n3. appoint executor(s) (number of executors not to exceed FOUR) to manage and distribute the assets.\n\nIf the deceased dies without a Will, the distribution of the assets and who can administer the estate will be governed by the law of intestate. This is discussed in the section [\"Distribution of estate to the relevant parties\"](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/probate/distribution_of_estate_to_the_relevant_parties).",

        "question": "What are some matters to consider for gifts to various beneficiaries?",
        "answer": "**Particular Beneficiaries (Minors, Children, Spouses, Executors, Employees & Charities etc)**\n\nMinors\nMinors cannot issue a valid receipt to personal representatives. A valid receipt releases personal representatives from their duty to distribute estate. Therefore, wills typically grant personal representatives the power to obtain a receipt from the minor's parent or guardian.\n\nChildren\nWithout any contrary intention in the will, the term \"child\" or \"children\" are typically interpreted to include both adopted children and illegitimate children (i.e. children who are born to parents who are not married to each other). However, if the testator intends to benefit natural and legitimate children only, they must clearly express this in the will. Also, stepchildren are not automatically included and must be specifically provided for in the will.\n\nSpouses\nA testator may choose to give their spouse either an absolute gift or a life interest in his estate. If the spouse is given an absolute gift, it may be subject to a survivorship clause, which requires the spouse to live longer than the testator by a specified period before they are eligible to receive the gift. Please refer to the section about \"Survivorship Clause\".\n\nExecutors\nUnless the executor is a professional executor, serving as an executor is an unpaid position. Therefore, a testator must specify in the will if he wishes to leave the executor a legacy for taking up the role. In that case, a testator must also specify the conditions in which the executor will receive the legacy, e.g. Will the executor only receive the legacy after he has obtained probate and administered the estate?\n\nEmployees\nThe testator should specify whether the employee will only receive the legacy if the employee is still in the testator's employment at the date of death.\n\nCharities\nThe testator must check and confirm the name, address and the charitable status of the charity. \n\nIf a gift is given to an unincorporated association, all members of that association receive that gift. Therefore, a receipt must be obtained from each member. To prevent such issues, the testator can include a provision in the receipt clause that specifies the receipt should only be given by an individual who appears to be the treasurer or another suitable officer of the organisation.",

Therefore, a testator may ask the proposed executor in advance to see whether he or she is willing to act. A testator should inquire the friend's age, expertise in administering the estate and whether the friend has conflicts of interests e.g. if the friend is also a beneficiary.\n\nA testator may contact the in-house lawyer of the NGO and inquire if the NGO is willing to act as an executor. To ensure that the appointment is valid and acceptable, it is best practice to incorporate the relevant standard terms and conditions of a trust corporation into the will.",

(2) If my grandmother died intestate, how is the estate distributed?",
        "answer": "For both (1) & (2), A and B will take 1/3 each, and D and E will take C's 1/3 share evenly (i.e. D and E will each take 1/6 of the estate of the grandmother).  \n\nIn relation to scenario (1), according to s.23 of Wills Ordinance, where a beneficiary of a will:\n- is a descendent of the testator;\n- passes away before the testator does; and\n- leaves behind issue.\n\nUnless the will shows contrary intention, that beneficiary's issue will take, in equal shares if more than one, the assets that the deceased originally left behind for that beneficiary.\n\nUnder the will in the instant scenario, the grandmother's estate was to be distributed among A, B and C equally. Since C was a descendent of the grandmother and passed away before she did, leaving behind issue D and E, D and E will take C's entitlement under the will in equal shares.\n\nIn relation to scenario (2), according to s.4 of the Intestate's Estates Ordinance, if the deceased leaves issue but no spouse, the residuary estate (i.e. the estate after deduction of the deceased's debts, taxes, funeral, legal and administration expenses etc) will be distributed as follows:\n\n- child(ren) of the deceased take equal shares (contingent on attaining the age of 18 or on earlier marriage), and\n- the issue of any child(ren) who pre-deceased the deceased take(s) equally their respective parent's share (contingent on attaining age of 18 or on earlier marriage).\n\nThe grandmother in the instant scenario had three children, A, B and C, had all survived the grandmother, each child would have taken the residuary estate in equal shares. However, since C has died before the grandmother did with two children (D & E) of his/her own, D and E will take equally C's share of the residuary estate when they reach 18 if not already have or married before 18.",

There are several steps the creditors could take to protect themselves:\n\n1. First of all, they should conduct a probate search at the [Probate Registry](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/probate.html) at the cost of $18. This could help ascertain whether there is a current application for a Grant of Representation or whether a Grant has been issued.\n2. If a Grant has been issued, the creditors can apply to the Court for a copy of the Grant (which contains the particulars of the executor/ administrator). The creditors can contact the executor/ administrator, and they may take legal actions to chase for the debts.\n3. If no Grant has been issued, the creditors can file [a Caveat](https://www.judiciary.hk/en/court_services_facilities/probate.html#16) (similar to a caution/warning notice, which costs $72 and lasts for 6 months) at the Probate Registry to ensure that the Caveat will have to be dealt with before the Grant can be issued.\n\nYou are advised to consult a solicitor for how to take appropriate legal actions to claim repayment.",

We are all treated as consenting to the inevitable personal contact arising from daily life.

The man must know that she does not consent or is reckless whether she consents or not. A man who argues that because of self-induced intoxication he did not understand she was not consenting and accordingly went ahead, is at least reckless whether she consents or not. He cannot claim that he honestly believed she was consenting and at the same time claim that, because of his intoxication, he did not understand her protestations that she did not want sexual intercourse.\n\nWhere the victim was intoxicated, the first question would be whether she consented to the act of sexual intercourse. Her intoxication may mean that she was factually unable to consent. If absence of consent is proved, the next question would be whether the defendant genuinely believed that she was consenting. This is a question of fact dependant upon the circumstances of the case. A man who plies a woman with alcohol, drugs or substances as part of a plan to have sexual intercourse with her, commits rape as soon as the act of sexual intercourse occurs.",

Once it is proved that the girl in question was under 13 years of age for a [section 123](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s123.html) charge, or under 16 years of age for a [section 124](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s124.html) charge, when the sexual intercourse took place, you are guilty of the offence whether or not you were aware of the girl's age. Your belief that the girl was over 13 years of age, or over 16 years of age as the case may be, is no defence.\n\nHowever, in relation to the offence of indecent assault contrary to [section 122](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/200/s122) of the [Crimes Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/200), while a person under the age of 16 cannot in law give any consent which would prevent an act being an assault, an honest and reasonable belief that the girl was aged 16 or over is a defence due to the Court of Final Appeal case of [HKSAR v Choi Wai Lun](https://www.hklii.hk/en/cases/hkcfa/2018/18?hl=HKSAR v Choi Wai Lun ).",

        "answer": "This will depend upon the particular case. There must be substantial interference with the possession of a parent or guardian over his or her child. Whether a girl is in the possession of her parent or guardian is a question of fact. A girl could still be in the possession of her parent or guardian while she is away from home if she intends to return. For example, where a girl is walking in the streets and she is forced onto a car and taken away, this will amount to a substantial interference with the possession of the parent. That conduct could also amount to the common law offences of false imprisonment or kidnapping: taking a person from the place where they are by force and against their will. Kidnapping is punishable by a maximum of 7 years' imprisonment. If there is doubt about whether the girl was in the possession of her parents and the removal is by force and without her consent, false imprisonment or kidnapping would more likely be charged.",

        "answer": "Yes. [Section 127](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s127.html) requires the taking to be with the intention the girl shall have sexual intercourse with men or with a particular man. That is the required corrupt motive or *mens rea* (guilty mind). There must be the sexual intercourse motive. If the prosecution cannot prove that was the defendant's purpose at the time of the taking, the defendant must not be found guilty.\n\nFor example, persuading a girl under 18 years of age to leave her parents because of violence she has received from a parent is not within [section 127](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s127.html). The purpose is to remove the girl from an abusive parent and not for the purpose of her having sexual intercourse with men or a particular man. In this situation there is an evidential burden upon the defendant to raise and support the non-corrupt purpose. The prosecution will then have to negative the claimed non-corrupt purpose by proving that the removal was for purpose of the girl having sexual intercourse with men or with a particular man.",

        "answer": "It depends upon the purpose of the girl leaving her parents.

In reality, a boy who helps his girlfriend who is 16 years of age or over to run away from her parents' home so that they can live together, would unlikely be charged with a [section 127](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s127.html) offence. It is not an offence to have sexual intercourse with a girl aged 16 or over. This is a relevant consideration in [section 127](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s127.html) situations. [Section 127](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s127.html) is an ulterior intent situation. There must be abduction.

To qualify for citizenship under that article, a foreigner must:\n\n \n\n1. have close relatives who are Chinese nationals;\n2. have settled in a part of China; or\n3. have other legitimate reasons for applying for citizenship.\n\nIn Hong Kong, all applications for naturalisation are handled by the Immigration Department in accordance with the [Chinese Nationality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance ](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/540/)([Cap. 540](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/540/) of the Laws of Hong Kong). More information about applying for naturalisation is available from the [website of the Immigration Department](http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/immigration/chinese/naturalisation.htm).\n\n \n\nSuccessful applicants for naturalisation are entitled to the same rights as persons who acquired Chinese nationality at birth.

        "question": "DO I HAVE TO BE PRESENT IN HONG KONG FOR 7 YEARS CONTINUOUSLY BEFORE I CAN ACQUIRE THE STATUS OF PERMANENT RESIDENT?",
        "answer": "Most newcomers to Hong Kong (whether they are from Mainland China or elsewhere) are required to live in Hong Kong for 7 years before they can acquire the status of Hong Kong permanent resident. This does not apply to newcomers who are already Hong Kong permanent residents (for example, Chinese nationals who were born outside Hong Kong to a parent who, at the time of birth, was already a Hong Kong permanent resident).\n\n \n\nIt is not necessary to be present in Hong Kong for the entire 7 years: the law merely stipulates that the person must be \"**ordinarily resident** \" in Hong Kong for that time. Ordinary residence may continue even though the person is absent for a temporary purpose. There is no clear and concrete definition of the term \"temporary purpose\", but [section 2(6)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/115/s2.html) of the [Immigration Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/115/) sets out some of the factors that may be taken into account in determining whether or not a person has ceased to be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nIf Hong Kong is your home and you go abroad for a temporary purpose, then your residency is considered to continue. This means that if you go somewhere else for a holiday, for business or to study, your ordinary residence is not interrupted. You can still accumulate 7 years of residence and the right of abode, even though you were absent during part of that period for a temporary purpose.\n\n \n\nThe 7-year period must be continuous, and only includes the period for which you have lawfully been in Hong Kong. Also, you must be in Hong Kong for a settled purpose (such as for employment, education or business purposes) during the entire 7-year period. A visitor or tourist cannot claim to be an ordinarily resident in Hong Kong, as visiting is not considered to be \"ordinary residence\".\n\n \n\nIt follows that a person could actually be in Hong Kong for 12 years but \"ordinarily resident\" only for two periods each of less than 7 years, broken by a period of unlawful or temporary residence. Such a person would not be entitled to permanent residence.",

        "question": "CAN FORMER RESIDENTS RETURN TO HONG KONG AND RENEW THEIR STATUS AS HONG KONG PERMANENT RESIDENTS?",
        "answer": "If such persons are Chinese citizens who are Hong Kong permanent residents but have lived elsewhere, then they are entitled to return to live in Hong Kong regardless of how long they have been away. The situation may be different [if they have lost Chinese nationality](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/immigration/chinese_nationality/q5) (in which case they may also lose their permanent resident status).\n\n \n\nForeigners (non-Chinese citizens) who have acquired the right to live in Hong Kong may also be entitled to return to live in Hong Kong after a period of absence, but it depends on the circumstances. For example, British citizens who acquired the right of residence during Hong Kong's colonial era may, depending on the circumstances, have the right to return and live in Hong Kong free of conditions of stay. However, this is a very complex area of the law, and legal advice should be sought from an expert.\n\n \n\nAlternatively, you can ascertain the Immigration Department's view as to whether or not you have lost your Hong Kong permanent resident status by applying for **verification of eligibility for permanent identity card** with the Right of Abode Section of the Immigration Department . The Right of Abode Section will assess whether or not you have lost permanent resident status. To contact the Right of Abode Section, please click [here](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/contactus/hq.html#9). If your application is rejected by the Right of Abode Section, you should seek legal advice from an expert. It is because the Immigration Department's approach tends to be restrictive and on closer analysis some persons who are rejected by the Department are later recognised as being entitled to live and work in Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nAnother point to note is that under [section 2AAA](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/115/s2aaa.html) of the [Immigration Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/115/), persons who were Hong Kong permanent residents but have lost that status are entitled to unconditional stay when they return.

        "answer": "The information that is set out here is intended as a general guide only. You should not make an important decision about immigration rights without consulting a lawyer who is knowledgeable in this area.\n\n \n\nBriefly, the different groups of people who may be entitled to settle in Hong Kong with their relatives are as follows.\n\n \n\n**A) Family members from Mainland China**\n\n \n\nAt present, a daily quota of 150 immigrants from Mainland China are granted a \"one-way permit\" to leave the Mainland to settle in Hong Kong . According to the rules and procedures of the Mainland (which are not governed by the Hong Kong SAR government authorities and courts), the following persons are eligible to apply for a one-way permit:\n\n \n\n1. The children of Hong Kong permanent residents of Chinese nationality who have the right of abode in Hong Kong according to [section 24(2)(3)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/instrument/A101/thebasiclaw.html) of the [Basic Law](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/instrument/A101/) and paragraph 2(c) of [schedule 1](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/115/sch1.html) to the [Immigration Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/115/) ( ***note** ).\n2. The spouses of Hong Kong permanent residents.\n3. Dependent children (who are not being cared for in the Mainland) who are coming to Hong Kong to join their relatives.\n4. Dependent elderly people (who are not being cared for in the Mainland) who are coming to Hong Kong to join their relatives.\n5. Persons who are coming to Hong Kong to take care of their dependent parents.\n6. Persons who are coming to Hong Kong to inherit property from Hong Kong relatives.\n\n( ***Note** : In the judgment of [Chan Kam Nga v Director of Immigration](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/1999/16.html) in January 1999, the Court of Final Appeal held that children acquire the right of abode in Hong Kong under article 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law if, **at or after**the time of their birth one or both of their parents was a Hong Kong permanent resident. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) issued an interpretation of the relevant part of the Basic Law later that year which clarified that for such children to exercise their right of abode in Hong Kong, their parent(s) must have already been a Hong Kong permanent resident **at the time** of the children's birth).\n\n \n\nResidents of Mainland China who wish to reside in Hong Kong must first obtain a **\"one-way permit\"** from the Mainland authorities. When persons who hold such permits arrive in Hong Kong, they are usually (but not always) granted permission by the Hong Kong Immigration Department to enter for the purpose of residence. Note that the one-way permit granted to persons in the foregoing category (i) must be affixed with a “certificate of entitlement” (see the following section).\n\n \n\nThe issue of such permits is the responsibility of the relevant Mainland authorities ([article 22(4)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/instrument/A101/thebasiclaw.html) of the [Basic Law](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/instrument/A101/)), although the Hong Kong SAR Government is consulted on questions such as quotas. The Mainland authorities are said to operate a points system for the allocation of one-way permits to close relatives of Hong Kong residents who reside in Mainland China.\n\n \n\nIf the dependants from Mainland China (who are applying for a one-way permit) are the children of Hong Kong permanent residents , they must also obtain a **\"certificate of entitlement\"** from the Hong Kong Immigration Department before they can enter Hong Kong to exercise their right of abode. The main purpose of this certificate is to provide prior verification as to whether such persons have the right of abode in Hong Kong according to article 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law and paragraph 2(c) of schedule 1 to the Immigration Ordinance. This certificate must be affixed to the one-way permit of the relevant immigrant before he or she enter Hong Kong. More information about how to obtain this certificate is given in the [guidance notes](http://www.immd.gov.hk/pdforms/ID881A.pdf) (in bilingual format) that are issued by the Immigration Department.\n\n \n\n**B) Family members from Macau**\n\n \n\nYou may be entitled to sponsor the following dependants from Macau to reside in Hong Kong with you:\n\n \n\n1. Your spouse.\n2. Any unmarried dependent children who are under the age of 18.\n3. Your parents if they are aged 60 or above.\n\nIn the case of the vetting and approval of entry for mmigration from Macao to Hong Kong, the Mainland authorities do not play any role. All applications are handled by the Hong Kong Immigration Department.\n\n \n\nMore details about the application requirements and the relevant application form can be found on the [website of the Immigration Department](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/residence_as_dependant.html).\n\n \n\n**C) Non-Chinese family members**\n\n \n\nYou may also sponsor a non-Chinese dependent spouse or child to enter Hong Kong to live with you. However, you must be able to show that you have sufficient financial resources to support and accommodate the new arrival. Dependent children must be under 18 years of age.\n\n \n\nEntry is granted to non-Chinese dependants at the general discretion of the Director of Immigration under [section 11](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/115/s11.html) of the [Immigration Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/115/) to admit any persons and to impose any conditions of stay. The Director operates the scheme under internal policy guidelines that may be amended from time to time without the need for legislation. It is important to note that the guidelines are guidelines only, and may be ignored in exceptional cases. The law requires the Director of Immigration to exercise the discretion on a case by case basis. If the Director refuses your application because it does not come within the guidelines and you consider the refusal to be unreasonable, you should seek legal advice from an expert.\n\n \n\n**D) Family members of non-permanent Hong Kong residents**\n\n \n\nThe most common types of persons who fall within this category are the children and spouses of non-Chinese Hong Kong residents who work in Hong Kong with [employment visas](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/immigration/visitors_tourists_and_employment_visas/). These children and spouses are required to apply for a dependant visa from the Immigration Department. If they are granted the visa, they will usually be permitted to reside in Hong Kong as long as their sponsor's employment visa lasts.\n\n \n\nAgain, these dependant visas are granted at the general discretion of the Director of Immigration. Sponsors must show that they have sufficient financial resources to support and accommodate their dependants in Hong Kong.\n\n \n\n**Other important notes**\n\n \n\nAs a general policy, only traditional lawful marriages are normally recognised – cohabitants or same-sex partners are excluded, although the legal power to admit spouses and children is discretionary and there is room for the Immigration Department to make exceptions.\n\n \n\nCertain categories of person, including foreign domestic helpers, are not permitted to sponsor dependants to reside in Hong Kong. However, domestic helpers who have children while living in Hong Kong may be able to gain permission for them to remain.",

Failure to comply with the above requirements is an offence that can result in fine or imprisonment.\n\n \n\nIt is important to note that the fixed salary is a minimum amount only (the minimum allowable salary is currently set at HK$4,410 per month). A foreign domestic helper and employer are entitled to agree to a higher salary in accordance with normal employment law.\n\n \n\nYou and your domestic helper must sign a standard employment contract as specified by the Director of Immigration. This is the only contract that is acceptable to the Immigration Department, and may be required for inspection when the helper arrives in Hong Kong.

        "question": "DO BRITISH CITIZENS HAVE TO APPLY FOR EMPLOYMENT VISAS IF THEY WANT TO WORK IN HONG KONG?",
        "answer": "During the colonial era, British citizens from the United Kingdom were permitted to enter Hong Kong with few restrictions. They were also entitled to work without employment visas. In line with the transfer of sovereignty, these privileges were abolished in 1997. British citizens are now required to seek permission to take up employment in Hong Kong unless, through long-term residence, they have acquired a legal right of residence (such as permanent resident status).",

        "question": "ARE SOME HONG KONG CHINESE PERSONS ENTITLED TO FULL BRITISH PASSPORTS (NOT BNO PASSPORTS)?",
        "answer": "Many tens of thousands of Hong Kong Chinese persons hold full British passports. Some may have been born in the United Kingdom or settled there before 1962 when immigration controls were imposed on Hong Kong people. Others may have been allowed to settle there since that time and have been naturalised as British citizens.\n\n \n\nThe majority of Hong Kong Chinese persons who are entitled to full British passports successfully applied for them under the nationality selection scheme, by which the United Kingdom granted full nationality to tens of thousands of Hong Kong people in the early 1990s. China objected to the nationality selection scheme at the time, and as a result, British nationality that was acquired under the scheme is not recognised under Hong Kong and Chinese law. Successful applicants are still considered to be Chinese. Their United Kingdom passports are not recognised in Hong Kong or elsewhere in China, and they are not entitled to the protection of the United Kingdom Government anywhere in China.\n\n \n\nUnder United Kingdom law, persons who acquired British citizenship under the nationality selection scheme are entitled to full citizenship rights, including the right to live and work without restriction in the United Kingdom and other parts of the European Union.\n\n \n\nThe nationality selection scheme lasted for only a limited period, and applications closed well before the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. However, successful applicants are entitled to renew their British passports for their lifetime, and may transmit full British nationality to their children.",

        "question": "WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I AM INVESTIGATED BY THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT?",
        "answer": "If you are investigated by the Immigration Department for any offence, you have the right not to answer any questions and to seek legal advice. It is always a good idea to seek legal advice before answering any questions. It can be intimidating to be questioned by an immigration officer, but you have no reason to be afraid if you assert your rights, and you should certainly do so. If you are arrested, you can ask the Immigration Department to release you on bail. If they refuse, you will be taken before a magistrate and you can apply for bail there.\n\n \n\nIf you are charged with any offence in a Magistrate's Court, you can seek the help of the Duty Lawyer Service. If your case is transferred to the District Court or the Court of First Instance of the High Court, you can apply for legal aid. A lawyer will be assigned to you if you are eligible for legal aid. More information about the free or subsidised legal assistance that is available in Hong Kong is provided in the [Legal Aid section](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/legalAid/).\n\n \n\nPersons who are found guilty of immigration offences are often refused permission to re-enter Hong Kong.\n\n## [RELATED WEBSITES](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/immigration/related_websites)\n\n## IX.

        "question": "THE INSURED PERSONS OR POLICYHOLDERS MIGHT SOMETIMES FAIL TO DISCLOSE ALL THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY. WILL SUCH A NON-DISCLOSURE LEAD TO THE REJECTION OF CLAIMS? WHAT IMPORTANT FACTS MUST BE DISCLOSED?",
        "answer": "The duty of good faith which applies to all insurance policies, means that the person buying the insurance policy must disclose all material facts (including personal information) in relation to the risk. This disclosure must be made to the insurance company from which the person is seeking to buy an insurance policy to cover the risk.\n\n \n\nNote, not all kinds of information are required to be disclosed. The person looking to buy insurance policy is only required to disclose information that is “material” to the risk. Information is “material” to the risk if it is information which is relevant and important for the insurance company to take into account when assessing the risk to decide whether or not to insure the risk and to determine the amount of premium to charge for the insurance policy. For example, if the information would cause the insurance company to set a higher premium than would be the case if the information is not disclosed, then the information is material and should be disclosed. Furthermore, the duty on the person seeking insurance is not just to disclose material facts about the risk which he actually knows, but to disclose material facts which he could reasonably be expected to know and disclose.\n\n \n\nOn receiving the relevant information the insurance company will make an assessment of the risk. Based on that assessment, the insurance company sets the terms and conditions and the rate of premium to offer to the person looking to buy. This process is called [underwriting the proposed insurance coverage](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary#i).\n\n \n\nA material non-disclosure occurs when the policyholder conceals or fails to disclose to the insurance company material facts that are relevant to the risk for which insurance is being sought. If there is a material non-disclosure, the insurance company will be able to avoid the insurance policy (i.e. when there is a claim, get out of having to pay the claim by handing back the premium and acting as if the insurance policy never existed). As such a material non-disclosure has serious consequences.\n\n \n\nFor example, a claim under a medical insurance policy may be rejected (and the policy avoided) if the policyholder did not disclose (prior to buying the insurance policy) that the insured person has a heart condition, as had the insurance company known that fact, it would have charged a higher premium.\n\n \n\nGiven the serious consequence a material non-disclosure can bring about, it vital that\n\n- A person answers all the questions in the insurer’s application form as fully and as honestly as possible. It is vital a person think carefully before giving an answer.\n- If a person has any uncertainty as to whether or not to disclose a particular piece of information to the insurance company, it is recommended that he err on the side of caution and disclose it.",

        "question": "FURTHER TO THE QUESTION ABOVE, IF A PIECE OF NON-DISCLOSED INFORMATION IS NOT RELATED TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM (E.G. I SUBMIT A CLAIM DUE TO AN INJURY FROM PLAYING FOOTBALL, BUT I HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED MY SMOKING HABIT), CAN THE INSURANCE COMPANY STILL REJECT SUCH CLAIM?",
        "answer": "As indicated in the answer to [Question 1](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/insurance/general_matters_concerning_all_types_of_insurance/q1), the question is whether the information is material (i.e. relevant) to the risk for which insurance is being sought. A medical insurance policy provides coverage for the medical costs when the person is ill or injured and needs to incur medical costs. If a person smokes that increases the risk of getting ill, so it is highly relevant (i.e. material) for an insurance company’s assessment of the risk of providing the person medical insurance. Indeed, it is likely the insurance company will charge a higher premium for the medical insurance policy if the policyholder is a smoker.\n\n \n\nSo if this fact is not disclosed, and the person later makes a claim under the insurance policy for medical costs arising from a football accident, the insurance company can reject the claim, avoid the policy and hand back the premium, even though the football accident has nothing to do with the person being a smoker. \n\n \n\nThis may seem unfair. That, however, is the result of an insurance policy being based on the principle of utmost good faith and the duty of disclosure. **If the non-disclosed information is vital enough to have affected the** [**underwriting decision**](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary#i) **of the insurance company, it may be legitimate for the company to decline a claim (and avoid the insurance policy) even though the non-disclosed information is not related to the current disease or injury.**\n\n \n\nThe disputes settled by [the Insurance Complaints Bureau](https://www.icb.org.hk/en/index.html) indicate that drinking and smoking habits are an important factor in the assessment of the risks in life or health insurance by insurance companies. As such, factors such as this (i.e. drinking or smoking habits) should be disclosed to the insurance company when buying these types of insurance policies.\n\n \n\nAgain, we would reiterate that it is imperative that when filling in an application for an insurance policy, a person answer the questions as fully and carefully as possible. If the person thinks of a fact which he is unsure whether it is material, it is better to be cautious and draw it to the insurance company’s attention.",

        "question": "I PAID THE PREMIUM ONE WEEK LATE (OR ONE MONTH LATE). IS MY POLICY STILL VALID? WILL THE INSURANCE COMPANY DENY MY CLAIM IF AN ACCIDENT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MY PREMIUM PAYMENT?",
        "answer": "Often insurance companies would include a \"grace period\" clause in their insurance policies.\n\n \n\nA \"grace period\" provides for a grace of, say, 30 or 31 calendar days (depending on the terms actually written in the insurance policy) to pay an overdue premium. The policy remains in force during the grace period. Thus, if a claim were made within the grace period, the insurance company is liable to pay the claim but the company has the right to deduct the amount of the overdue premium from the proceeds of the payment of the claim.\n\n \n\nNote, however, that particularly in some commercial insurance policies, insurance companies may include a premium warranty clause, whereby the premium must be paid by certain date and if it is not paid by that date, then the coverage is void. \n\n \n\nIt is therefore important for you to check your insurance policy, to understand the terms which apply to payment of premium.",

        "question": "THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAS DELAYED PROCESSING MY CLAIM. CAN I CLAIM INTEREST DUE TO SUCH A DELAY?",
        "answer": "If there is an express term in the insurance policy providing for payment of interest by the insurance company for having delayed the payment of a claim, a contractual right would exist for payment of interest in the event of delay, provided that the policyholder has not himself breached any terms in the insurance policy. However, it is very rare for insurance policies to include such a clause.\n\n \n\nThat stated, if it can be shown that there was an undue/improper delay on the part of the insurance company, a complaint can either be lodged with [The Insurance Complaints Bureau](https://www.icb.org.hk/en/how_lodge_complaint.html) (the \"ICB\") to seek to recover interest for the delay. If the claim falls within the Terms of Reference for the ICB, therefore, this is a potential avenue to be able to claim interest.",

CAN I CLAIM FOR THE SUM INSURED UNDER ALL POLICIES OR JUST THE ACTUAL EXPENSES/LOSSES ONLY? IS THE CLAIM FOR THE DEATH BENEFIT UNDER LIFE INSURANCE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT RULES?",
        "answer": "An insured person is not prevented by the law from purchasing any number of insurance policies covering the same item/person for the same risk. However, for insurance policies which are based in the indemnity principle, there is normally an \"other insurance\" clause in the insurance policy to address these situations so as to avoid the policyholder seeking to recover more than his loss.\n\n \n\nThe “other insurance” clause will set out the liability of the insurance company where the policyholder has also purchased \"other insurance\" to cover the same risk. The “other insurance” clause often provides for one of three results:\n\n \n\n- The most harsh “other insurance” clause provides that the insurance company will have no liability on the insured item/person in which the insured person has purchased other insurance (leaving all loss to be recovered from the other insurance policy).\n- The “other insurance” clause may provide that the insurance company will only be liable for the loss in excess of the cover for the risk provided by the other insurance policy (also known as an “excess” provision).\n- The “other insurance” clause may provide that the insurance company will only pay a pro-rata portion of the loss, with the other insurance policy.\n\n \n\nThe above are the types of “other insurance” clause commonly seen in medical, personal injury and property insurance policies (which are usually based on the indemnity principle).\n\n \n\n“Other insurance” provisions aim to prevent the policyholder from obtaining unfair enrichment under the [Common Law](https://www.clic.org.hk/en/glossary#c). In other words, the total amount of the claims payable under the \"primary insurance\" (the subject policy) together with the \"other insurance\" (the other policies) should not exceed the fair value of the repair or replacement of the insured item (i.e. the fact that the policyholder has multiple insurance policies should not enable him to recover more than his total loss or expenses incurred).\n\n \n\nAccordingly, a policyholder can claim under all of his insurance policies. Depending on their terms, however, the claims may be adjusted according to the express provisions under the \"other insurance\" clauses in each of the policies. \n\n \n\nExample : You have taken out two medical insurance policies in which the sum insured for medical expenses is $10,000 for each policy (aggregate sum insured is $20,000). If your medical bill is $15,000, you can only obtain $10,000 from one of the policies and get $5,000 from the other one. (You cannot obtain $10,000 from one insurance policy and another $10,000 from the other insurance policy, because this would be more than your medical bill of $15,000).\n\n \n\nThe position as regards **life insurance** policy is different (as this is contingency insurance). Here, if there is nothing untoward (e.g. fraud or misrepresentation), the insurance company will be liable to pay in full regardless of there being other policies under which claims could also be made.",

The \"other insurance\" must cover the same risk, the insurance coverage is additional, and the relevant policies are valid and subsisting.\n\n \n\nTypically, the clause may set out the liability of the insurance company where the insured person has also purchased \"other insurance\", which could be categorised as follows :\n\n \n\n- The \"escape\" provision whereby the insurance company will have no liability on the insured item/person in which the insured person has purchased other insurance;\n- The \"excess\" provision whereby the insurance company will be liable for the amount of the excess insurance over and above the \"other insurance\" only; and,\n- The \"pro-rata\" provision whereby the insurance company's liability will be limited to a proportion of the loss.\n\n \n\nThe above is the position as regards **medical, personal injury and property insurance**.\n\n \n\nThe provisions above intend to prevent the insured person from unfair enrichment under the [Common Law](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary#c).

        "answer": "Yes, you can name your son (who is a minor) as the beneficiary of your life policy.\n\n \n\nYou should arrange to name a guardian and/or trustee to receive and manage the proceeds on his behalf until he reaches the age of majority after which he can inherit all the proceeds directly.",

        "answer": "The rule under the law is that a minor (a person under the majority age of 18), usually cannot make contracts. An exception to this rule is that if the contractual goods or services are considered as \"necessaries\" for the minor, such contract is legally binding (please refer to the topic of [Consumer Complaints](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/consumer_complaints/consumer_contracts/q2)).\n\n \n\nIf the insurance contract is beneficial to the minor, the contract may be upheld by the Court. In practice, when a minor submits an application for buying life insurance, the insurance company may first assess the income of that minor (i.e. whether or not he/she can pay the premiums).\n\n \n\nYou should also note that a minor can be named as the \"beneficiary\" in a life insurance policy (please refer to the [relevant question and answer](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/insurance/common_types_of_insurance/life_insurance/q9)).",

        "question": "IF MY INSURANCE POLICY HAS LAPSED AND I TRY TO \"REINSTATE\" MY POLICY BY PAYING THE PREMIUMS AGAIN, CAN I SUBMIT ANY CLAIMS TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY AT THIS STAGE?",
        "answer": "Normally, there is a \"reinstatement\" clause by which a life insurance policy that has lapsed (usually due to non-payment of premiums) can be reinstated. The policy can be brought back into force again even though the policy was no longer in force.\n\n \n\nIt will usually be less expensive to reinstate a policy than to purchase a new one. The premium for a new policy would likely be more expensive due to the fact that the insured person is older. Therefore, the person's risk profile would likely fall into a higher premium category.\n\n \n\nThe \"reinstatement\" clause usually permits the policyholder to reinstate the policy , provided that certain conditions are met with, for example:\n\n \n\n- The insured person shows to the insurance company evidence of insurability (e.g. a satisfactory medical report). This condition is usually waived for lapses of less than two months;\n- All the overdue premiums plus any interest payable are all paid up-to-date;\n- Any policy loan (derived from the cash value of the policy) taken out must be either repaid or reinstated;\n- The policy has not been surrendered to the insurance company in return for cash; and,\n- The period lapsed must not be more than three years.\n\n \n\nDuring the time in which the reinstatement of the policy is being processed, any claim submitted would be held pending the approval of the reinstatement application by the insurance company.",

I RECEIVED A LUMP SUM FROM AN INSURANCE COMPANY DUE TO A PERMANENT DISABILITY BUT SURPRISINGLY RECOVERED TWO YEARS LATER. CAN THE INSURANCE COMPANY ASK ME TO REFUND PART OF ITS PREVIOUS PAYMENT?",
        "answer": "A disability, in the context of injuries, refers to the inability to carry on with one's normal activities and occupation as a result of sickness or accident.\n\n \n\n\"Permanent disability\" is a disability that the insured person will not recover from. \"Temporary disability\" is one that the insured person will recover from.\n\n \n\nA medical certificate must be submitted together with the claim as evidence of the insured person's condition of disability. Payment of the benefit for permanent disability may be made at one time in one lump sum or over a period of time by a series of payments.\n\n \n\nIn the above question, you have received a lump sum. Unless the payment was conditional in which you are required to refund the payment if you recover partially or wholly in future, then the insurance company cannot ask for a refund.\n\n \n\nIn usual cases, the standard terms in an insurance policy would not have a condition requiring refund where a lump sum is payable. By contrast, where the benefit is payable by installments, there could be a condition that the insured person provides proof to the insurance company from time to time of his/her continuous permanent disability. It depends on the specific terms of the policy in question.",

        "question": "IF I HAVE RECEIVED COMPENSATION FROM PERSONAL INJURY LITIGATION AGAINST THE WRONGDOER, WILL IT BE USED TO SET OFF PART OF MY CLAIM FROM MY INSURANCE POLICY?",
        "answer": "There should be a \"subrogation\" clause which is also a standard term in an insurance policy.\n\nUnder this clause, if your insurance company has already paid your claim, your rights and remedies are \"subrogated\". In simple words, the insurance company is placed in your position and takes over all of your rights and claims against the defaulting party. Note that your insurance company can only exercise the right of subrogation if it has admitted and paid your claim under your insurance policy.\n\n \n\nAccording to the facts in the above question, you have in effect exercised your rights and have already obtained compensation from the wrongdoer. In this case, the compensation may be offset against the liability of your insurance company under the policy it has issued to you.\n\n \n\nExample : You have obtained $20,000 as compensation from the defaulting party via personal injury proceedings. However, your insurance company should pay you $40,000 according to your insurance policy. Since you have already received $20,000 from the wrongdoer, you will only get $20,000 from the insurance company.\n\n \n\nThe principle of subrogation is to prevent the insured persons from making a profit out of their insurance policies.\n\n \n\nFor details about personal injury litigation, please go to another topic – [Personal Injuries](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/personalInjuries/).",

In both cases, the amount of compensation will likely be less than the original purchase price. The ordinary wear and tear factor, and the deprecation, will normally be included in the calculation of the compensation.\n\n \n\nHowever, where the insured property is a valuable article, the value of the property and the amount of compensation can be agreed beforehand. In the event of loss or total damage, the insurance company is liable to pay the agreed amount.\n\n \n\nIn the example of a painting or an antique, the insurance company may appoint an expert to determine the fair value of the painting/antique before agreeing to the insured amount.",

The official record might be needed as evidence in any subsequent insurance claims and legal proceedings. To avoid the coverage being affected, the driver should generally avoid settling or agreeing to any matter on his/her own with any of the other parties involved without the prior consent of the insurer, in particular where there are injuries to any third party.\n\n \n\nAs soon as practicable after the accident, the driver should notify the car owner (if he or she is not the car owner) and the insurer. The notification to the insurer (which is generally required to be made in writing) should be made within the time specified at the relevant motor insurance policy to avoid any potential breach of policy condition. The driver should also keep the insurer informed of the case progress (e.g. the date of taking police statement, the laying of information or charge sheet, the date of court hearing etc.) and seek the insurer’s directions on how to proceed with the matter. For any prosecution against the car owner or the driver, the insurer may, in some cases, take over the defence of the proceedings and instruct its own legal adviser in assessing the merits of defence.",

        "answer": "As described in the first part of the question, you are the registered owner (i.e. the legal owner) but not the \"real\" or \"beneficial\" owner of the car. As the registered owner, you still have an insurable interest in the car.

        "answer": "If the car is insured by the loss and damage cover, the driver should not arrange to repair the car by himself or herself without consulting the insurer first. If the car is damaged in a traffic accident, the driver should immediately contact his/her insurer so that the insurer can instruct its own surveyor or adjustor to assess the extent of the damage, the repairs need to be done, as well as the costs to be involved. Where towing fees are covered under a motor insurance policy, your insurer may sometimes instruct you to engage towing service provider(s) designated by it if such service is required.\n\n \n\nSubject to the directions given by the insurer on repair based on the findings of its own surveyor, the car owner can either claim for the reasonable repair costs or have the repairs carried out at the agreed sum.\n\n \n\nUpon paying your repair costs and any other relevant expenses / losses (e.g. towing fees, expenses incurred for renting substituted car), generally speaking your insurer is entitled under the terms of the motor policy to commence recovery action against the wrongdoer (if any) on your behalf by its subrogation rights (i.e. the right to subrogate your claim for property damage and loss against the wrongdoer upon providing indemnity to you under the policy). You may be required to provide reasonable assistance to the insurer for initiating and conducting the recovery claim.

        "answer": "Even though utilization of technology in the insurance sector brings tremendous benefits, you should be careful of the following:\n\n \n\nAs a rule of thumb, insurance products with simple features are suitable for buying and selling via a virtual insurer; On the other hand, if the insurance product of which you are considering is complex or involves a substantial and long-term commitment (e.g. a product with a long premium payment period, or with advanced features such as different payout options), you may want to purchase such products via an insurance intermediary who can explain the details of the insurance policy to you and assist you in handling matters in relation to the insurance policy.\n\n \n\nTypically, if you choose to buy insurance policies from a virtual insurer, no insurance intermediary would explain the features of the insurance product and give you advice on whether such insurance product is suitable for you having regard to your financial conditions and insurance needs.  Hence you should make sure that you have read through and understand the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, including the insurance coverage and the existence of exclusion clauses. You should also be aware of the risks associated with the insurance policy, e.g. the surrender charge which can cause substantial loss if you fail to pay premiums on time. If you do not understand any part of the policy, you should consult representatives from the virtual insurer, or consider obtaining an advice from an insurance intermediary.\n\n \n\nMoreover, cybersecurity is a major concern for virtual insurers and other application of Insurtech with heavy reliance on the Internet. To this end, the Insurance Authority has a [Guideline on Cybersecurity](https://www.ia.org.hk/en/legislative_framework/files/Guideline_on_Cybersecurity_English.pdf) and all insurance companies, including virtual insurers, must comply with at all times. You should also strive to protect yourself against cyber risks when obtaining insurance policies via Internet or using online services provided by insurance company, e.g. to use private network connection and keep your passwords strictly confidential.\n\n \n\nAlso, the use of technology in our modern society causes a grave concern on privacy and personal data, and Insurtech has no escape from it.  In Hong Kong, all personal data collected by insurance companies are under the protection of the [Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/486/) ([Cap. 486](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/486/)). You should pay attention to how your personal data collected by insurance company is handled, for instance you should read carefully the Personal Information Collection Statement (“PICS”) which would list out for what purpose(s) can the insurance company use your personal data. When using a mobile application developed by an insurance company, you should check the privacy settings and what permissions are granted to this application.",

        "answer": "Prior to switching your life insurance policy to another insurance company, you should be careful that your agent is not making inaccurate or misleading statements or comparisons to persuade you to switch. This is not uncommon as your agent could earn a commission from your switching to another insurance company (where the agent is also switching to a new insurance company).\n\n \n\nReplacing an existing life insurance policy with a new insurance policy may bring certain risks and consequences which you need to consider carefully:\n\n- Financial implications\n  - Life insurance policies usually last for a long period of time. If you surrender your existing life insurance policy, particularly during the early years of the policy period, you will usually suffer loss;\n  - The cash value that you may receive from surrendering your existing life insurance policy may be less than your total premium paid;\n  - You may be subject to withdrawal or surrender charges;\n  - In purchasing a new life insurance policy, a substantial part of the initial premium may be used to pay for policy administration and insurance intermediaries costs;\n  - You may have to pay higher premium under the new life insurance policy in view of the difference in age and changes of health and other conditions; and\n  - You may lose the financial benefit accumulated over the years (e.g. loyalty bonus or dividends) under the existing life insurance policy.\n\n \n\n- Insurability implications: \n  - If you purchase a new life insurance policy to replace an existing life insurance policy, some benefits, which are the policy features of the existing life insurance policy, may not be covered under the new life insurance policy due to changes in age, health conditions and occupation, etc.; and\n  - Riders / supplementary benefits under your existing life insurance policy may not be available under the new life insurance policy.\n\n \n\n- Claims eligibility implications:\n  - Benefits under the existing life insurance policy will no longer be payable to you if you surrender the policy or allow it to lapse; and \n  - You may need to start a new waiting period in respect of certain benefits (e.g. medical, critical illness, suicide or incontestability) under the terms and conditions of the new life insurance policy.\n\n \n\nIn Hong Kong, to protect life insurance policy holders’ interest, subject to some exceptions, licensed insurance intermediaries are generally required to advise customers who are considering to replace an existing life insurance policy with a new policy whether the arrangement is in their best interests taking account of any reduction in the total cash value or sum insured under the existing policy, and any other adverse consequences.\n\n \n\nIn order to protect consumers against the above risks, there is a requirement for them to complete the Important Facts Statement - Policy Replacement (the \"IFS-PR\", which can be found as Appendix B in the [Guideline on Long Term Insurance Policy Replacement](https://www.ia.org.hk/en/legislative_framework/files/GL27_English.pdf) issued by the Insurance Authority). Where there is a switching or replacement of a policy, the insurance agent must declare on the IFS-PR that he/she has fully explained the risks that would be involved to the client. The client must also declare that he/she understands the risks concerned.\n\n \n\nIn summary, make sure that your insurance agent is not making inaccurate or misleading statements or comparisons to persuade you to switch. Any additional genuine and legitimate benefit available under the new policy may make it worth switching, but you must be clear of the potential risks and what could be done to manage these risks.",

        "answer": "For most life insurance policies, insurance companies are required to provide benefit illustrations to the customers at the point-of-sale according to the following requirements:\n\n \n\n- An authorized insurer should prepare an inforce re-projection illustration based on the current policy option chosen by the policy holder (e.g. withdrawal, premium offset, top-up, etc.), and the updated actuarial assumptions and the authorized insurer’s current view of the market outlook.\n- The re-projection should start from the policy year in which the re-projection is performed, taking into account the policy’s updated inforce policy status (e.g. attained age, current sum assured, etc.).\n- Relevant warnings of associated risks and explanatory notes should be suitably modified and presented.\n\n \n\nFor some particular product types (e.g. ILAS, participating, universal life (non-linked) and non-participating policies), authorized insurers are required to provide further information to the customers according to additional requirements applicable to the specific product types.",

        "answer": "Life insurance policies are generally long term in nature and may lock up the liquidity of customers. It is therefore important for authorized insurers and licensed insurance intermediaries to ensure that a proper assessment of a customer’s circumstances including his/her needs, financial condition, ability and willingness to pay premiums, etc., is undertaken before any recommendation is made in respect of a suitable life insurance policy for the customer, and that the recommendation is based on such financial needs analysis (“FNA”).\n\n \n\nAn authorized insurer or a licensed insurance intermediary is required to collect relevant and sufficient information from a customer to conduct the FNA before making recommendation in respect of certain types of life insurance policies. \n\n \n\nIf a customer refuses to disclose information during the FNA process, the licensed insurance intermediary would be unable to comply with the FNA requirements, and consequently the licensed insurance intermediary could not recommend any insurance product to the customer.",

The monthly living expenses and medical fees during retirement, together with inflation cost, could be a substantive burden for a typical retiree.\n\n \n\nMPF is an employment-based retirement protection system of which employees and employers make regular mandatory contributions at 5% respectively of the employee’s relevant income, subject to the minimum and maximum relevant income levels.

        "answer": "You should refer to the full wording of the questions asked or the information requested in the motor insurance application form. In general, insurers would pose questions relating to your personal particulars (e.g. age and driving experience), your car’s particulars (e.g. model, engine number, chassis number, etc.) and the driver’s previous driving history (e.g. whether you have been involved in any traffic accident or been convicted of any traffic offence within a specified period of time). You should make full and frank disclosure in answering those questions and providing the requested information in the application form. The actual scope of disclosure (for example, what kind of traffic offence conviction is required to be disclosed) is subject to the relevant wording in the application form.\n\n \n\nIf you have omitted to provide any required particulars or (innocently or otherwise) provided false particulars in answering the questions stated in the application form, your insurer may apply for a declaration to avoid your motor insurance policy based on non-disclosure or misrepresentation of facts if such particulars are material, i.e. the particulars are of such nature as to influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in determining whether the insurer will take the risk, and if so, at what premium and on what conditions.\n\n \n\nRegarding the amount of premium, it is generally calculated in accordance with a set of data including your age, occupation, driving experience and records, the type of motor insurance policy being applied for, the model and valuation of your vehicle, as well as your past claim history and traffic conviction records (different insurers may have different formula of calculation). However, you should note that in most of the cases, the amount of premium potentially saved by withholding / misrepresenting material particulars would be outweighed by the potential adverse impact of the avoidance of your motor insurance subsequently by your insurer (which results in you being personally liable for paying compensation to the any third party claim). Hence, if you are in doubt as to whether certain particulars need to be disclosed, it would be prudent to disclose it to the insurer.",

        "answer": "Apart from your personal safety concern, you should note that there are two aspects of travel insurance that may be relevant to your travel plan.\n\n \n\nThe aspect is a common exclusion that loss arising from a direct or indirect consequence of war, invasion, act of foreign enemies, civil war, rebellion, revolution, riot, performing duties as a member of armed forces or other law enforcing agencies would be excluded for cover.  \n\n \n\nThe other aspect relates to trip cancellation or curtailment cover. Generally speaking, trip cancellation cover entitles you to claim back wasted expenses which are not recoverable from any other party (e.g. non-refundable air ticket fare) if your trip is cancelled as a direct result of an insured risk. Similar, there may as well be trip curtailment cover in your policy. Generally speaking, cover for curtailment entitles you to claim back a pro-rata refund of any pre-paid accommodation, car hire or holiday excursions you will no longer be able to use following your return home. Under some policies, curtailment will also cover reasonable travel expenses you have had to pay on your return journey unless travel has been arranged for you by your travel insurer.\n\n \n\nYou should review your policy and consider whether it is appropriate for you to proceed with your trip. Contact your insurer and ask about scope of coverage in your policy, especially if you are planning not to proceed with your travel plan.",

        "answer": "In addition to the matters as discussed in Section C above, the following matters may be relevant to you.\n\n \n\nFirstly, you can choose between a single-trip policy and an annual policy depending on your travel frequency. If you travel with sufficient frequency, buying an annual travel insurance policy may help you to save money and also the trouble from purchasing a new travel insurance each time before travelling. \n\n \n\nSecondly, you should review the territory(ies) covered by your travel insurance. While some policies provide worldwide cover, other policies may limit its cover to certain countries (e.g. Asian countries or European countries) at varying premiums. Even if you have purchased an annual policy, you should also check whether the country(ies) you are going to visit is within the covered territories of your annual policy each time before you travel.\n\n \n\nThe third issue is the activities you are going to planning to do covered or not covered under your insurance plan. Some examples of high risk activities and extreme sports are paragliding and kitesurfing, rock climbing, mountain biking, skydiving, trekking, surfing, skiing and snowboarding. The cover for these activities. When in doubt, you should always contact your insurer to clarify the coverage issue.",

        "answer": "Given the relatively low level of premium and the potential adverse consequence of being uncovered by insurance, it would probably be in your interest to have your trip covered by travel insurance, regardless of its duration. \n\n \n\nSome airline companies and travel agencies are licensed insurance agencies and they do offer to their customers their principal insurers’ travel insurance plans. You may choose to purchase through them an insurance plan that meet your needs. Please note that the policy is a contract of insurance between the travel insurer and you. Your purchase decision should not be lightly made without an understanding of the terms and conditions of the travel insurance plan. Further, when you purchase air tickets online, you should check whether any add-on insurance service has been opted-in or not (i.e. whether the box to purchase has already been pre-checked for you) to avoid paying for a policy that you are not intended to buy.

If the student distributed the photocopies to his classmates for profit (e.g. he asked for a service charge in addition to the cost of making the photocopies), he would infringe the copyright of the book by selling infringing copies. This would incur not only civil liability but also criminal liability, in which he may also be liable to a fine and imprisonment.\n\n \n\nHowever, even if the distribution was not for profit, it might be regarded as being \"to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the copyright owner\", as the distribution was to the entire class. In such a case, the student would still be liable for copyright infringement, incurring both civil and criminal liabilities.\n\n \n\nIt is important to note that whether or not the distribution was for profit, the defence of \"fair dealing for private study\" was not open to that student, as he had made multiple copies for others (see [section 38(2)(b)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/s38.html) of the [Copyright Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/)). Fair dealing is one of the exceptions to copyright infringement and more information can be found in [section B](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/intellectualProperty/infringement_of_copyright/B).\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, regardless of whether the classmates had paid for the photocopies or not, they would not be liable, as they have not committed any act contrary to the [Copyright Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/).",

However, you should note that if you possess a pirate VCD in the course of trade or business, you will be liable for [secondary infringement](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/intellectualProperty/infringement_of_copyright) which incurs civil liability. That is, the owner of the copyright in that VCD can sue you for compensation. Furthermore, if your possession of the pirate VCD in the course of trade or business is with a view to committing further acts of infringement, your possession will also give rise to criminal liability in which you are liable to a fine and imprisonment.\n\n \n\nApart from this, if you perform certain acts in respect of the pirate VCD, such as making an additional copy of the VCD, or showing the film contained in the VCD in public, you will certainly incur liability for such acts of infringement.",

        "answer": "Yes, the placing of a hit song on your website without the consent of the copyright owners is an infringing act even if it is purely for sampling purposes (see [section 26](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/s26.html) of the [Copyright Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/)). Such an act does not fall within the permitted acts under the Copyright Ordinance (see [section B](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/intellectualProperty/infringement_of_copyright/B)).\n\n \n\nIf you place only part of a hit song on your website, your act will still infringe upon the copyright of the song if the part is a substantial part (assessed qualitatively but not quantitatively) of the hit song. Generally speaking, a part of a work will be regarded as a substantial part of the work if the part contains enough of the author's skill and labour to merit protection. A part of a hit song used for sampling purposes, which would normally the most popular or attractive part of the song, is likely to be considered a substantial part of the hit song.",

        "answer": "In reply to the first question, the answer is No. By virtue of [section 60](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/s60.html) of the [Copyright Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/), a lawful user of a computer program may make a back-up copy of the program without infringing the copyright in the program if it is necessary for him to have the back-up copy for the purposes of his lawful use. However, this is all subject to the terms of the user licence for that computer program. If the user licence prescribes certain conditions for making a back-up copy, the user must comply with those conditions when making the back-up copy.\n\n \n\nFor the second question, the installation of a computer program is governed by the terms of the user licence for that computer program.

        "answer": "After 28 November 2003 , copies of computer programs lawfully made in other countries will not be regarded as infringing copies for the purposes of [section 35(3)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/s35.html) of the [Copyright Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/).

        "question": "I AM A TEACHER AND HAVE FOUND A GOOD ARTICLE IN A MAGAZINE. CAN I MAKE PHOTOCOPIES OF THE ARTICLE AND DISTRIBUTE THEM TO MY STUDENTS FOR CLASS DISCUSSION?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can do so by relying on [section 41A](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/s41a.html) of the [Copyright Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/), which allows fair dealing with a copyright work by a teacher for the purposes of teaching at school. In assessing whether your making of photocopies is fair dealing, the following four factors are important:\n\n \n\n1. the purpose and nature of the dealing;\n2. the nature of the work;\n3. the amount and substantiality of the portion dealt with in relation to the original work as a whole; and\n4. the effect of the dealing on the potential market for or value of the work\n\nThus, as a general rule, your making of photocopies should be reasonable and necessary for your class discussion, and should not amount to a substitute for buying a copy of the magazine. To be prudent, you should ensure that your photocopying is not excessive (eg. making just enough copies for classroom use) and that you only photocopy the part that is necessary for the class discussion (eg. photocopying only those passages which are relevant to the discussion).\n\n \n\nApart from [section 41A](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/s41a.html), you may follow the [Guidelines for Photocopying of Printed Works by Not-for-profit Educational Establishments](https://www.ipd.gov.hk/en/copyright/faqs-and-guidance-notes/copyright-and-education/guidelines-on-photocopying-of-printed-works-/index.html) issued by the Intellectual Property Department for making photocopies for classroom use.\n\n \n\nThe Guidelines allow you to make photocopies of a complete article in newspapers or periodicals (clause E(6)(a)(i) of the Guidelines) under the following conditions:\n\n \n\n- Multiple copies of a work may be made by or on behalf of a teacher giving a course (clause E (1)).\n- Copies made are for the purpose of distribution to students for teaching, discussion or classroom use. Students may retain the copies for subsequent reference (clause E (2)).\n- The number of copies made should not exceed one copy per student in a course (clause E (4)).\n- There should not be more than 27 instances of copying made for one course in one academic year (clause E (5)).\n\nFurthermore, you should note that the making of photocopies must comply with the conditions of spontaneity (clause D (4)), brevity (clause E (6)), and cumulative effect (clause E (7)).\n\n \n\nThese conditions are rather stringent. In particular, \"spontaneity\" is defined to mean that \"the time of the decision to use the work and the proposed time of its use in the classroom should be so close that it would be unreasonable to require the teacher to obtain permission for the copying. If the time between the decision and the proposed use is three working days or less then for the purpose of this clause, it will be deemed unreasonable to require the teacher to obtain permission for the copying.\" Thus if you decide to make photocopies of a work for your teaching well before they are to be used in the classroom, you cannot rely on the Guidelines for protection.",

        "answer": "Under the existing law, placing copies of copyright materials on your own website without the licence or permission of copyright owners is infringement, even if it is for educational purposes. However, you can place them on the school's Intranet without infringing copyright by relying on [section 41A](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/s41a.html) of the [Copyright Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/), which permits a teacher to place copies of copyright works on the school's Intranet for the purposes of teaching. But you should note the pre-condition for [section 41A](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/s41a.html): namely, that your placing of copies of copyright works on the school's Intranet is fair dealing (see the discussions under [\"Fair Dealing\"](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/intellectualProperty/infringement_of_copyright/B) and the four factors). Generally speaking, those copies of copyright works placed on your school's Intranet should be reasonable and necessary for your teaching, and should not amount to a substitute for buying the original book or publication containing those works.\n\n \n\nIn addition, the exemption under [section 41A](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/s41a.html) is subject to two conditions:\n\n \n\n1. there are technological measures adopted to restrict access to the copies of copyright works on the school's Intranet to ensure that they are made available only to persons who need to use them for the purposes of teaching or learning; AND\n2. the copies are not stored in the Intranet for a period longer than is necessary or, in any event, longer than 12 consecutive months.\n\nIf either one of these conditions is not complied with, the exemption under [section 41A](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/s41a.html) will not apply, and you will infringe copyright unless you have obtained a licence from the copyright owners.",

        "question": "WHAT SHOULD I NOTE BEFORE MAKING AN APPLICATION FOR A PATENT? WHAT IS THE REGISTRATION PROCEDURE?",
        "answer": "In Hong Kong, there are two types of patents: \n\n \n\n- Standard patents (with a maximum term of protection of 20 years); and\n- Short-term patents (with a maximum term of protection for 8 years).\n\n \n\nOther than the duration of protection provided, the application procedures for the two types of patents are also different. \n\n \n\nA standard patent can be obtained by either:\n\n \n\n- Filing a standard patent application directly in Hong Kong without first filing the patent application in designated patent office (known as **standard patent (O)**); or\n- Re-registering a patent granted by a “designated patent office” overseas (known as **standard patent (R)**) in Hong Kong. There are currently three designated patent offices: the State Intellectual Property Office of China, the United Kingdom Patent Office, and the European Patent Office (with the patent application designating the United Kingdom).\n\n \n\nA short-term patent can also be obtained by making a direct application in Hong Kong without having to rely on any prior patent granted elsewhere. In contrast to standard patent, the short-term patent does not require substantive examination of the patentability of the invention. A short-term patent can be obtained much quicker than a standard patent and is most suitable for short-term products where a patent needs to be obtained quickly for protection.\n\n \n\nFor either type of patent, you must make full disclosure of the details of the invention in your application, otherwise your application will be rejected. Furthermore, for a patent to be granted, the invention must satisfy three main requirements ([section 9A](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/514/s9a) of the [Patents Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/514)):\n\n \n\n- The invention is susceptible to industrial application. That is, it can be made or used in any kind of industry;\n- The invention is new. This generally means that the invention was not known to anyone anywhere in the world before the patent application was filed; and\n- The invention involves an inventive step (novelty). This generally means that at the time the patent application was filed, the invention was not obvious. \n\n \n\nApplying for a patent requires careful drafting of the patent application. Poor drafting may result in a business loss or litigation with other patent owners. Although it is not a legal requirement, you are strongly advised to employ a patent agent or a lawyer to help you write the patent specification, and to communicate with the relevant patent office on your behalf. This is particularly so if you wish to apply for a patent overseas (which is a necessary prior step for obtaining a standard patent (R) in Hong Kong).

(Note: A \"kit\" means a complete or substantially complete set of components intended to be assembled into an article.)\n\nInfringement of a registered design is a civil wrong (i.e. the infringer would incur civil liability) . In legal proceedings for infringement of a registered design, the owner of the design is entitled to seek:\n\n \n\n- damages (compensation);\n- injunction (a court order forbidding the infringer to continue selling the goods under the relevant registered design);\n- surrender the infringing goods; and\n- surrender the profits derived by the infringer in respect of the infringing goods.",

        "question": "HOW DO I OBTAIN COPYRIGHT?",
        "answer": "Generally, to enjoy copyright protection, a work must be original and be recorded in a material form. If these conditions are satisfied, copyright will arise automatically, and **there are no requirements for registration or other formalities**. Under the [Copyright Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/528/), works by authors from anywhere in the world, or works first published anywhere in the world, are all eligible for copyright protection in Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nIn the context of copyright, \"original\" simply means that the work originates from the author (i.e. not copied from elsewhere) and that it involves the author's skill and labour. Copyright does not require a work to be of high quality or aesthetic value. Nor does it require a work to be creative or new. However, works which are trivial or involve little skill and labour will not be protected. Thus titles, names, and short phrases are generally not protected by copyright (but can be protected as [trade marks](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/intellectualProperty/trade_marks/)). Mere ideas also do not enjoy copyright.",

        "answer": "If the work is a published work, it will usually contain a copyright notice giving details of copyright ownership. If there is no copyright notice but there are details of authorship, you may contact the author to ascertain the owner of the copyright.\n\n \n\nIf the above does not help you find out who is the copyright owner of the work, you may have to contact collecting societies representing copyright owners to see if the work is in copyright and whether any collecting society represents the copyright owner. (For a list of the major collecting societies in Hong Kong , please go to [question 5](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/intellectualProperty/copyright/q5).)

        "answer": "The basic rule is to ask for permission from the copyright owner. If you know who the copyright owner is, you may contact the owner directly. If you do not know who the copyright owner is, you may start with the collecting societies that represent copyright owners.\n\n \n\nCurrently, there are a few collecting societies in Hong Kong representing authors, publishers, composers, lyricists, and record producers. The main function of these collecting societies is to negotiate licensing terms, grant licences and collect licence fees on behalf of the copyright owners for the use of their copyright works. At present, the major collecting societies are as follows.\n\n \n\n- [Hong Kong Reprographic Rights Licensing Society (HKRRLS) ](http://www.hkrrls.org/), representing authors and publishers of printed works (books, magazines, newspapers, journals, and periodicals).\n- [Hong Kong Copyright Licensing Association (HKCLA) ](http://www.hkcla.org.hk/), representing authors and publishers of 12 local newspapers and 19 local magazines.\n- [Composers and Authors Society of Hong Kong Limited (CASH) ](http://www.cash.org.hk/), representing composers and lyricists of musical works.\n- [Phonographic Performance (South East Asia) Limited (PPSEAL) ](http://www.ppseal.com/), representing producers of musical sound/visual recordings.

However, you need to go through the [case merits test](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary) if you want to appeal against conviction or sentence.\n\n \n\nUnder the regulations, subject to the financial means test, legal aid will be granted if the Director of Legal Aid is satisfied that it is desirable in the interests of justice to do so. Everyone is presumed innocent until he is proved guilty and so the interests of justice generally require legal representation be given to an accused person who cannot afford the legal costs for hiring private lawyers for dealing with a criminal charge. Legal aid will therefore generally be granted to an accused person for dealing with a criminal charge so long as he can satisfy the financial means test. In other words, there is no case merits screening for [committal proceedings](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary) or for trials in the District Court or High Court.\n\n \n\nBut if an applicant has been convicted and wants to obtain legal aid for appeal, the Director of Legal Aid must further be satisfied that the applicant has meritorious grounds of appeal. In other words, for appeal cases, the applicant must satisfy both the means test and the merits test.",

Legal Aid will normally be granted if the applicant is able to satisfy the[financial means test](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary) and the [case merits test](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary).",

        "question": "Mr. Zhang knows that the Legal Aid Department is a Government Department. He is afraid that the lawyers and staff of the Legal Aid Department, being civil servants, may not help him full-heartedly against the Government. Is his concern justified?",
        "answer": "Although the Legal Aid Department is a Government Department, it has a long and established practice of being run independently and impartially. It is the duty of the Legal Aid Department to provide Legal Aid for qualified applicant and to maintain professional standard and ethics. Moreover, there is a statutory body named [Legal Aid Services Council](http://www.lasc.hk/index.html) which would oversee the administration of the legal aid services provided by the Legal Aid Department.\n\n \n\nAs Mr. Zhang is taking action against the Government, upon granting of Legal Aid, the Legal Aid Department will normally assign lawyers in private practice to represent him in the proceedings to avoid any possible conflict of interest. Mr. Zhang may request the Legal Aid Department to assign a solicitor or barrister in private practice whom he trusts to represent him. If Mr. Zhang's suggested lawyer is on the [Legal Aid Panel](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary) and the suggested lawyer has the time and expertise to represent him in the proceedings, the Director of Legal Aid will usually respect his choice.",

        "question": "Mr. Zhang used to earn $20,000 per month, but he can no longer work as a result of the injuries. He owns a flat where he and his family live. The flat has a current market value of $5,000,000. He has $150,000 as savings in a bank, and some Hong Kong Bank shares with a market value of $100,000. He has outstanding medical bills amounting to $110,000. His wife, who is a housewife, has about $80,000 as her savings. The couple live together with their 30-year-old son, who earns $40,000 per month as an engineer and has $500,000 as savings. \nIs Mr. Zhang financially eligible for Legal Aid?",
        "answer": "First, we need to assess Mr. Zhang's[financial resources](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/legalAid/freeOrSubsidisedLegalAssistanceInHongKong/legalAidSchemeForCriminalCases/q1_financialResources)according to the [Legal Aid (Assessment of Resources and Contributions) Regulations](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/reg/91B/).\n\n \n\nFinancial resources are calculated by adding the applicant's [disposable capital](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/legalAid/freeOrSubsidisedLegalAssistanceInHongKong/legalAidSchemeForCivilCases/q1_financialResources#q2) to his yearly [disposable income](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/legalAid/freeOrSubsidisedLegalAssistanceInHongKong/legalAidSchemeForCivilCases/q1_financialResources#q3). If the applicant is married, the spouse's income and capital will be treated as the applicant's for calculating the financial resources unless they have already separated or divorced, or that they have conflicting interest in the proceedings.Other family members' income or assets will not be taken in account.\n\n \n\nDisposable capital consists of all the applicant's assets of a capital nature, such as cash, bank savings, jewellery, antiques, stocks and shares, flats and properties. But it does not include the value of the applicant's flat if he normally lives in it, nor his household furniture, personal clothing and tools of trade. The value of any outstanding debt or liability of the applicant cannot be taken into account in reducing the applicant's disposable capital (unless the applicant has actually repaid it before the application for Legal Aid).\n\n \n\nHence, in assessing Mr. Zhang's financial resources, his wife's assets will be included while his son's assets and income will be excluded. The value of his residential flat will be excluded. As he can no longer work and earn income, his disposable income will be treated as zero. Accordingly, Mr. Zhang's financial resources amount to $330,000.\n\n \n\n**Details of Calculation**\n\n \n\n| *Disposal Income*           | His Income                | Nil            |\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------- |\n|                             | His Wife's Income         | Nil            |\n|                             | His Son's income          | Not applicable |\n| *Disposal Capital*          | His Savings               | $150,000       |\n|                             | His Hong Kong Bank Shares | $100,000       |\n|                             | His Wife's Savings        | $80,000        |\n|                             | His Son's savings         | Not applicable |\n|                             | Residential flat          | Not applicable |\n|                             | Outstanding medical bills | Not applicable |\n| *Total Financial Resources* |                           | $330,000       |\n\nAs it now stands, Mr. Zhang is not financially eligible for the Ordinary Legal Aid Scheme, because his [financial resources](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/legalAid/freeOrSubsidisedLegalAssistanceInHongKong/legalAidSchemeForCriminalCases/q1_financialResources) have exceeded the limit of $420,400 But as his [financial resources](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/legalAid/freeOrSubsidisedLegalAssistanceInHongKong/legalAidSchemeForCriminalCases/q1_financialResources) are between $420,400.01 and $2,102,000, he can satisfy the financial means test under the Supplementary Legal Aid Scheme.

        "answer": "Mr. Zhang needs to contribute more money for the services under the Supplementary Legal Aid Scheme than under the Ordinary Legal Aid Scheme.\n\n \n\nUnder the Ordinary Legal Aid Scheme, the contribution fee payable by an applicant ranges from $768 to $76,783(depending on his assessed financial resources). However, under the Supplementary Scheme, the applicant must first pay a non-refundable application fee of $1,000 and an interim contribution of $76,783 upon acceptance of Legal Aid. If he wins and recovers any damages, he needs to pay a contribution amounting to 10% of the damages (This contribution will be reduced to 6% if the case is settled before a barrister is briefed to attend the trial).\n\n \n\nPlease compare [Answer 8](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/legalAid/caseIllustration/civilCaseIllustration/) and [Answer 9](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/legalAid/caseIllustration/civilCaseIllustration/) to see the actual difference in the net sums Mr. Zhang eventually obtains under the two Schemes.

        "answer": "No. The Director of Legal Aid has no power to grant Legal Aid under the Ordinary Scheme if the [financial resources ](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/legalAid/freeOrSubsidisedLegalAssistanceInHongKong/legalAidSchemeForCriminalCases/q1_financialResources)of the applicant exceed $420,400. The only exception is that the Director of Legal Aid may waive the financial resources limit in [human rights related litigation](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary). But Mr. Zhang's case is not human rights related litigation.\n\n \n\nHowever, Mr. Zhang has outstanding medical bills amounting to $110,000.

The police have refused to release him on bail. He is brought to the Kwun Tong Magistrates Court this morning.\n\n \n\n**Question 1:** \nMr. Mo does not know what to do.

As Mr. Mo is held in custody, he will be contacted automatically by the staff of the Court Liaison Office at the cell of the Kwun Tong Magistrates Court before the hearing. The staff will ask him whether he wants to have free legal representation from the Duty Lawyer Scheme. As this is his first court appearance, the Scheme will not assess Mr. Mo's financial situation and will not charge him any fee.\n\n \n\nOnce Mr. Mo confirms that he wants to have the service, the staff will take instructions from him as to (1) his personal and family background; (2) whether or not he intends to plead guilty to the charge; (3) in case he intends to plead guilty, what he wants the duty lawyer to say to the court in mitigation; and (4) if the case is adjourned, whether he wants to apply for bail and the proposed conditions for the bail.\n\n \n\nLater the duty lawyer (who is a qualified solicitor or barrister in private practice) will visit him at the cell of the Kwun Tong Magistrates Court before the hearing to take further instructions from him and answer his queries. He can seek advice from the duty lawyer as to whether he should plead guilty or about the bail application.\n\n \n\nThe duty lawyer will then appear for him at the first hearing before the Magistrate.",

Hence his financial resources are $61,800.\n\n \n\n**Details of Calculation**\n\n \n\n| Monthly Disposal Income  | His Income                     | $15,000        |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------- |\n|                          | LESS                           |                |\n|                          | Rental                         | ($6,000)       |\n|                          | Salaries TaxPersonal Allowance | ($130)($6,220) |\n|                          |                                | $2,650         |\n| Yearly Disposable Income | ($2,650 x 12)                  | $31,800        |\n|                          |                                |                |\n| Disposal Capital         | His Bank Savings               | $30,000        |\n| Total Financial Resource |                                | $61,800        |\n\nMr. Mo therefore satisfies the means test for the Legal Aid Scheme, because his financial resources do not exceed the limit of $420,400. Legal Aid will normally be granted to an accused person for dealing with a criminal charge so long as he can satisfy the means test, without considering the merits of his defence.\n\n \n\nMr. Mo should therefore be able to obtain Legal Aid for the criminal proceedings in the District Court.",

Six months after the pre-notification letters are issued, the BD issues statutory notices to the owners of the target buildings requiring them to carry out the prescribed inspection and any prescribed repair works found necessary in respect of the common parts, external walls and projections or signboards within the specified time frame. After the issuance of statutory notices, the list of buildings concerned is uploaded to the BD’s website.\n    \n3. The building owners served with a statutory notice under the MBIS (in most of the cases, the co-owners or OC of the building concerned) must appoint an RI to carry out the prescribed inspection within the specified time frame.\n    \n4. The RI must carry out the prescribed inspection personally, unless exempted by the relevant provisions of the subsidiary legislation, to ascertain whether the building has been rendered dangerous or is liable to become dangerous.\n    \n5. If the RI considers that a prescribed repair is required, the owners concerned must appoint a registered general building contractor (RGBC) or a registered minor works contractor (RMWC) who is registered for the relevant repair works to carry out the prescribed repair under the supervision of an RI (who may be the same as or different from the RI that carried out the prescribed inspection, as the owners may decide).\n    \n6. Upon completion of the prescribed inspection and prescribed repair, the appointed RI must submit an inspection report and a completion report respectively, together with a certificate in the specified form, to the BA for record and audit check.\n\n**MWIS**\n\n1. The BD issues pre-notification letters to the OC or posts the letters at a conspicuous part of the target buildings one to two months before the issue of statutory notices to give advance notice to the building owners of the requirement to carry out the prescribed inspection and any subsequent repairs, if required. The pre-notification letters are not issued to each of the individual owners.\n    \n2. One to two months after the pre-notification letters are issued, the BD issues statutory notices to the owners of the target buildings, requiring them to carry out the prescribed inspection and any prescribed repair works found necessary in respect of the windows within the specified time frame. After the issuance of the statutory notices, the list of buildings concerned is uploaded to the BD’s website.\n    \n3. The building owners served with a statutory notice under the MWIS must appoint a QP to carry out the prescribed inspection within the specified time frame.\n    \n4. The QP must carry out the prescribed inspection personally to ascertain whether the windows have been rendered dangerous or are liable to become dangerous.\n    \n5. If the QP considers that a prescribed repair is required, the owners concerned must appoint an RMWC (who is registered for the minor works required in respect of the windows) or an RGBC to carry out the prescribed repairs under the supervision of a QP (who may be the same as or different from the QP that carried out the prescribed inspection, as the owners may decide).\n    \n6.

        "answer": "Ignoring sexual harassment does not make it go away, but may make it worse because the harasser may misinterpret no response as approval of the behaviour. The Equal Opportunities Commission has recommended some informal and formal strategies that can be used:\n\n \n\n- Speak up at the time. Tell the harasser that his/her behaviour is unwelcome and has to stop;\n- Keep a written record of the incidents, including dates, time, places, presence of any witnesses, nature of the harassment (what the harasser said and did) and your responses;\n- Tell someone you trust;\n- Identify an expert or counsellor who can provide emotional support and information about informal and formal institutional procedures;\n- Write a letter/note to the harasser;\n- Report it officially (e.g. to a senior staff in the company or the school principal);\n- Complain to the Equal Opportunities Commission (please refer to [Part VI: How to Complain](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/how_to_complain));\n- Contact the police and/or file a lawsuit.\n\nThe judgment of a District Court Equal Opportunities Action in 2000 (please click [here](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkdc/2000/14.html) if you want to read the whole judgment) has explained that whether or not sexual conduct is unwelcome and unlawful depends on two questions: i) whether the complainant welcomed or accepted the conduct at the relevant time (but not whether a \"reasonable person\" would have welcomed it); and ii) whether the circumstances were such that the harasser should have realized that his/her approaches were unwelcome.\n\n \n\nMost sexual harassment court cases requires the victim to prove that \"unwelcome sexual conduct\" has occurred, therefore, it is very important that you expressly tell the harasser to stop right at the beginning of the incident. Otherwise, you may have great difficulty proving the existence of \"unwelcome sexual conduct\" if you subsequently lodge a complaint or institute legal proceedings.",

        "question": "IF AN INCIDENT INVOLVING SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAPPENED IN AN OFFICE OR ANOTHER PART OF THE WORKPLACE, TO WHAT EXTENT MAY THE EMPLOYER BE HELD RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE?",
        "answer": "With reference to [section 46](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/480/s46.html) of the [SDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/480/), employers may also be liable for acts of sexual harassment committed by their employees in the course of employment, regardless of whether or not the acts were done with the employers' knowledge or approval. However, it is a defence for the employers to show that they have taken reasonably practicable steps to prevent employees from committing such acts. The [Code of Practice on Employment under the Sex Discrimination Ordinance](https://www.eoc.org.hk/en/training-and-education/eo-club/code-practice-on-employment/sex-discrimination-ordinance) (issued by the Equal Opportunities Commission) contains some practicable steps or guidelines for employers' reference. The important points are highlighted below:\n\n \n\n- employers should issue a policy statement to employees which expressly states that sexual harassment at work is unlawful and will not be permitted;\n- the statement should also expressly state that employees have a right to complain if they are suffering from sexual harassment;\n- a co-ordinator, preferably with special training, should be designated to establish and administer both formal and informal complaints procedures.\n\nThere may be both formal and informal ways of dealing with complaints of sexual harassment. The two approaches are both valid and can be included in a sexual harassment policy. The approach to take will usually depend on the wishes of the complainant. Employers need to set out clear procedures for both approaches and make the information available to all staff. This is particularly important in helping staff to understand the steps involved when making a complaint of sexual harassment.\n\n \n\nConfidentiality would also strengthen any policy regarding handling sexual harassment. In short, any information relating to a complaint of sexual harassment must only be given out on a need-to-know basis. Employers need to ensure that managers understand this principle when dealing with such complaints. Adopting such a principle gives assurance to the complainant or potential complainant that management appreciates the sensitive nature of sexual harassment and that the details of complaint will not be disclosed to other colleagues.\n\n \n\nFor more information on how to formulate a policy on handling sexual harassment at work, please refer to clauses 19 – 22 of the Code of Practice.",

        "question": "HOW DOES THE EOC HANDLE A COMPLAINT? UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE EOC DISCONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION OF A COMPLAINT?",
        "answer": "The EOC is required by law to investigate the complaint. Allegations by the complainant are sent to the respondent/discriminator for comment. Responses (if any) are then made available to the complainant. Witness statements are taken and pertinent materials are gathered to see if the case should be discontinued or proceed to conciliation (see [the next question](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/how_to_complain/q5)). All information gathered during the investigation stage is kept confidential from third parties but may be used in court proceedings.\n\n \n\nThe EOC may decide not to conduct or to discontinue an investigation into a complaint if:\n\n \n\n- more than 12 months have passed since the discriminatory act was done;\n- the act complained of is not unlawful;\n- the aggrieved person does not desire to continue with the investigation;\n- the complaint cannot be pursued appropriately only as a representative complaint (i.e. the complaint should be personally lodged by the aggrieved person instead of being lodged through a representative);\n- the complaint is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance.\n",

        "question": "HOW DOES THE EOC CONCILIATE A CASE? CAN THE AGGRIEVED PERSON REQUEST CONCILIATION?",
        "answer": "After receiving a complaint, the EOC must first carry out an investigation and decide whether to discontinue the case, or proceed to conciliation. When the investigation is completed, either side can also request that the case be settled through conciliation. However, **conciliation is completely voluntary and either party can stop the process at any time**.\n\n \n\nThe conciliator of the EOC assists both parties to examine the issues that led to the complaint, identify points of agreement and negotiate a settlement to the dispute. The conciliator does not represent either side but only acts as a facilitator.\n\n \n\n***What are the advantages of conciliation?***\n\n \n\n- Conciliation is free;\n- It is less time consuming than going to court;\n- Unlike court cases, there is no media exposure to the individual parties;\n- It is less formal compared to court trial.\n\n***What settlement terms can I ask for during the conciliation procedure?***\n\n \n\nTerms depend on the circumstances of the dispute. Normally, it is a reversal of the situation that led to the complaint. For example, if a person was dismissed, he could ask to be re-employed. If he was denied a promotion or transfer, he could ask for the promotion or transfer. If training was denied, he could ask for the admission of the training course. Any of these items could be made as a condition in the settlement term. Other possible items include:\n\n \n\n- a letter of apology;\n- implement of equal opportunities policies;\n- financial settlement/compensation;\n- construction of physical access, etc. (for physical disability cases)\n\nFor more information about the conciliation procedure, please go to the [EOC webpage](http://www.eoc.org.hk/EOC/GraphicsFolder/showcontent.aspx?Leaf=1&content=About Conciliation).",

        "answer": "If the conciliation is not successful, the complainant can apply to the EOC for legal assistance to commence a civil lawsuit in the District Court. The granting of legal assistance by the EOC is not guaranteed. It may be granted if the EOC thinks that it is unreasonable, because of the complexity of the case or the complainant's position in relation to the respondent, to expect the complainant to deal with the case unaided.\n\n \n\nLegal assistance may include the giving of legal advice, representation by the EOC's lawyers, legal representation by outside lawyers or any other form of assistance the EOC considers appropriate. A committee of the EOC considers all applications. If you wish to seek further information from the EOC, please click [here](https://www.eoc.org.hk/en/about-the-eoc/contact-us).\n\n \n\nIf you fail to get legal assistance from the EOC, you may consider the Legal Aid Scheme run by the Legal Aid Department.

        "question": "UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES CAN AN EMPLOYER REFUSE TO EMPLOY OR DISMISS A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY? SUPPOSE I HAVE A SERIOUS LEG INJURY, DOES IT MEAN THAT I HAVE NO CHANCE TO TAKE UP A JOB?",
        "answer": "In general, it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee on the grounds of disability. The [Disability Discrimination Ordinance (\"DDO\")](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) applies to all employers in Hong Kong unless their employees wholly or mainly work outside Hong Kong ([section 11](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s11.html) and [section 14](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s14.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/)).\n\n \n\nHowever, the above protection for job applicants or employees with a disability is not absolute. An employer may specify that a job applicant or an employee should not be a person with a certain type of disability because such person would be unable to carry out the **inherent requirements** **of that particular employment** ( [section 12(2)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s12.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/)). For example, an employer may specify that persons who are wheelchair bound need not apply for jobs like gym instructors, as an inherent requirement of the job of gym instructors is to help people use the gym equipment and perform the relevant demonstrations.\n\n \n\nApplying the above gym instructor example, if you have a leg injury (in which you cannot perform the demonstrations) and you apply for this job, the employer can turn down your application on the grounds that you cannot carry out the inherent requirements of the job.\n\n \n\n***How can one assess whether a job applicant/employee with a disability can carry out the inherent requirements of a job?***\n\n \n\nThe inherent requirements of a job are those that are necessary for achieving the goals of the job (i.e. the duties and responsibilities that an employee must be able to perform/undertake). In determining whether or not a person with a disability can carry out the inherent requirements of the job, the employer is required to take into account:\n\n \n\n1. the person's past training, qualifications and experience relevant to the particular employment;\n2. in the case of an existing employee, his/her work performance; and\n3. other relevant factors (e.g. Is the injury/disability a permanent or temporary one? If it is a temporary disability, when is the approximate date of recovery?).\n\nFor example, if a typist is required to type at least 50 words per minute, then typing 50 w.p.m. is an inherent requirement of this job. Having no physical disability or being without any illness may not necessarily be an inherent requirement of this job.\n\n \n\nApplying the above typist example, if you have a leg injury (but you can type at least 50 w.p.m.) and you are now handling this job, the employer will violate the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) if he/she dismisses you on the grounds that you cannot carry out the inherent requirements of the job.\n\n \n\n***How will I know if I can perform the inherent requirements of a job?***\n\n \n\nIn reality, a person with a physical disability can, like other people, take up many jobs. An employer should be able to tell you about the inherent requirements of the job. To help you find out, try to get a copy of the job description beforehand and study the list of duties and responsibilities. The job interview should also be used as an opportunity to ask more questions about the nature of the work involved.\n\n \n\n(A note to employers: If job applicants or existing employees cannot perform the inherent requirements of a particular job, employers must consider whether it is feasible to provide \"reasonable accommodation\" to help them perform the job duties. For more information on this matter, please go to [question 7](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/discrimination_due_to_disability/q7).)\n",

        "answer": "It may be lawful to discriminate against (including dismiss) an employee who has an infectious disease, if it is reasonably necessary for the protection of public health (i.e. to prevent the spreading of such disease to other colleagues or customers). However, it is generally NOT acceptable to dismiss a person or discriminate against them on this basis unless the job is such that there is a risk of spreading the disease through physical or bodily contact.\n\n \n\nUnder the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/), infectious diseases are the diseases set out in [Schedule 1](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/599/sch1.html) of the [Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/599/) (e.g. tuberculosis and viral hepatitis) and any communicable disease specified by the Director of Health in the Government Gazette.\n\n \n\nAccording to [section 61](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s61.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/), however **,** neither HIV infection nor AIDS is to be treated as an infectious disease. In that case, it may be unlawful to discriminate against an employee with AIDS.\n\n \n\nEmployers should also note that many infectious diseases can be cured after proper treatment. Therefore, the granting of sick leave is always an alternative to immediate dismissal.\n\n \n\nBefore dismissing an employee with an infectious disease, the employer must comply with the provisions of the [Employment Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/57/) (please refer to another topic – [Employment Disputes](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/employmentDisputes)) and should consult a lawyer if necessary.",

        "answer": "With reference to [Code of Practice on Employment under the DDO](http://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/graphicsfolder/showcontent.aspx?content=cops_ddo) (issued by the Equal Opportunities Commission), if a person with a disability can perform the [inherent requirements of the job](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/discrimination_due_to_disability/q2) with some adjustments, including the provision of certain services or facilities, employer is required to consider making such adjustments. Making adjustments that are required to ensure equal opportunities for people with a disability is commonly referred to as providing **reasonable accommodation**. Reasonable accommodation may be made at any stage of employment, according to the needs of the person with the disability.\n\n \n\nIf you are a person with a physical disability, you may frankly tell your employer that all people with a physical disability want to work independently and not to depend on the help of other colleagues. Your employer must try to provide reasonable accommodation in the workplace. For example, your employer can check the access to the building, the steps, the office corridors and toilets, to see whether these facilities need any alteration; he/she may install some special facilities for people with a disability; he/she may also provide you with flexi-hours in the office, so that you can perform the inherent requirements of the job.\n\n \n\nHowever, according to clause 11.8 of the [Code of Practice](http://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/graphicsfolder/showcontent.aspx?content=cops_ddo) and [section 12(2)](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s12.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/), it may be lawful to discriminate against (e.g. refuse to employ or dismiss) a person with a disability if providing reasonable accommodation would impose **unjustifiable hardship** on the employer. That is to say, the person or organisation that provides the reasonable accommodation to the disabled person would suffer a lot as a result. The most typical examples of unjustifiable hardship are the poor financial circumstances of the employer, and the huge amount of expenditure (including recurrent expenditure) required to be made by the person or company claiming unjustifiable hardship.\n\n \n\nIt clearly may be difficult for persons/organisations with limited resources to spend a lot of money making adjustments in order to provide reasonable accommodation for an employee with a disability. The [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) allows the financial capacity of an organisation to be taken into account. For more information on this issue, please refer to clause 11.18 of the [Code of Practice](http://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/graphicsfolder/showcontent.aspx?content=cops_ddo) or [section 4](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/s4.html) of the [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/).\n\n \n\n(Note that the principles of reasonable accommodation and unjustifiable hardship apply to cases relating to physical disability as well as other kinds of disability.)\n\n \n\nIf a dispute is brought to court and the employer claims unjustifiable hardship in defence of not providing reasonable accommodation, the burden of proving the expense is not justifiable falls on the employer.\n\n \n\nIn short, an employer must not claim that a disabled person cannot perform the inherent requirements of a job without first considering the provision of reasonable accommodation, or treat that person less favourably than people without a physical disability.\n",

A driver who has difficulty in providing such assistance to a passenger should clearly explain his/her difficulty to the passenger.\n- To facilitate the boarding and alighting of taxis by persons with a disability in restricted zones, the Transport Department and the Hong Kong Council of Social Service have prepared a **\"Certificate for Picking Up or Setting Down of Passengers with Disabilities in Restricted Zones\"** for use by persons with a disability.

In addition, handrails should be installed, and any barriers such as flowerpots or litter bins should be placed out of the way so that the access of people with a physical disability will not be hindered.",

This means that your employer may also be held responsible for your colleagues' behaviour, even though your employer may not approve or know of it. However, your employer may be exempt from this liability if the company has already implemented a policy to handle discrimination, harassment and vilification relating to disability (e.g. complaint handling measures).

        "answer": "It may be unlawful for an employer to dismiss you on the grounds of your chronic illness or the regular treatment for your illness. The [DDO](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/487/) requires employers to first analysis whether an employee can perform the [inherent requirements of a job](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/antiDiscrimination/discrimination_due_to_disability/q2).\n\n \n\nIf the illness is so serious that makes you unable to perform the inherent requirements of your job, your employer can dismiss you.

        "question": "Default – when may the lender terminate the loan agreement and demand repayment of the loan and all other sums due?",
        "answer": "A loan agreement usually sets out various events of default, the occurrence of which will entitle the lender to refuse to allow any further drawdown, to demand immediate repayment of all or part of the loan and other sums due from the borrower, and to enforce any security provided for that loan.\n\n \n\nEvents of default\n\nThe following are some common events of default:\n\n1. Non\\-payment: failure to pay any amount due, be it principal, interest or other charges, would constitute an event of default.\n2. Breach of covenants: while a breach of the covenants under the loan agreement is often an event of default, the borrower is typically given a grace period to remedy the breach if it is capable of being remedied. The grace period would usually commence from the borrower’s awareness of its failure to comply or upon receiving notice from the lender of such failure to comply.\n3. Misrepresentation: this occurs when any representation made in the loan agreement or other security documents are incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed to be made.\n4. Cross default: cross default means that a borrower’s default on another loan is to be treated as an event of default. Such other loan may be with the same or different lender and the scope may extend to cover loans by the borrower’s related companies (in the case of a corporate borrower).\n5. Winding\\-up petition and insolvency: if the borrower or other security providers are wound up or insolvent, or there are circumstances indicating this might be the case, this would usually constitute an event of default.\n\n \n\nAcceleration and cancellation of commitment(s)\n\nA loan agreement may contain an acceleration clause providing that once an event of default has occurred, the lender may declare the loan immediately due and payable. In other words, this clause allows the lender to demand early repayment of the loan once an event of default occurs. \n\n \n\nA loan agreement would also include a clause permitting the lender to cancel the commitment(s) upon the occurrence of an event of default, and the borrower would not be permitted to make any further drawdown.",

THAT PHOTO, I BELIEVE, WAS SECRETLY TAKEN BY SOMEONE WHILE I WAS WINDOW-SHOPPING IN AN ARCADE ONE WEEK AGO. CAN I SUE THE RELEVANT WEBMASTER OR THE PHOTOGRAPHER UNDER THE PERSONAL DATA (PRIVACY) ORDINANCE?",
        "answer": "The legal question to ask is whether the photograph taken amounts to \"[personal data](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/personalDataPrivacy/6_data_protection_principles/)\". If that photograph is not personal data, then the Ordinance is not applicable in this case.\n\n \n\nWith reference to a Court of Appeal case in 2000 ([Eastweek Publisher Limited and another v Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2000/442.html)), it was ruled that personal data can be collected by means of photographs. However, it does not mean that all photographs must necessarily be personal data. In order for personal data collection to existence, the data user must be compiling information about an **identified person** or about a person whom the data user intends or seeks to identify. In other words, taking a photo merely showing a person's visual image which was taken not for collecting data relating to him/her as an identified person (i.e. the person is only an \"anonymous photographic subject\") is normally not classified as personal data collection and DPPs are thus not engaged.\n\n \n\nAs elaborated in the judgment of the above case, the Ordinance only protects the privacy of individuals in relation to personal data. It is not intended to establish general privacy rights against all possible forms of intrusion into an individual's privacy sphere (a general right to be left alone).\n\n \n\nIn reply to the subject question, you cannot be protected under the Ordinance if in the circumstances, the photo was taken not for collecting data relating to you as an identified person.\n\n \n\nDespite the above ruling, it is important to note that persons who publish photos with captions that contain personal data of the photo subjects (without their consent) may have violated the Ordinance. If such captions contain unjustified adverse comments on the photo subjects, the publishers may also have incurred civil liability for **defamation**. Furthermore, persons who take photos on such occasions (i.e. in a public place without the photo subject's consent) and cause any person to be reasonably concerned for his/her safety may have committed the offence of loitering ([section 160](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/200/s160) of the [Crimes Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/200)), or may be charged with behaving in a disorderly manner in a public place.",

        "answer": "No. A credit provider can only obtain a credit report about you in limited situations.\n\n \n\nThe Code allows a credit provider to obtain your credit report when a credit provider:\n\n \n\n- considers your application for a new credit facility (e.g. a new loan);\n- conducts a credit review of your existing credit facilities; or\n- conducts a renewal of those existing credit facilities when due.\n\n(Note: The word \"review\" means consideration by your credit provider of an increase or decrease in the credit amount.)\n\n \n\nYour credit provider may also obtain your credit report when you fail to repay an amount that is overdue so that it can monitor your indebtedness.\n\n \n\nHowever, your credit provider is not allowed to access your credit data for other purposes such as using the data for direct marketing purposes.",

        "answer": "Yes, the bank may report this information to a CRA. A credit provider may provide credit data collected from the borrower to a CRA. These credit data will include information regarding the borrower and the guarantor (if any).\n\n \n\nThe definition of \"consumer credit\" under the Code makes reference to the user of the facility, i.e. whether it is granted to and for the use of an individual, or to and for the use of another person for whom an individual acts as a guarantor. As the meaning of the word \"person\" includes not only a natural person but also a legal person (e.g. a limited company), a corporate loan guaranteed by an individual will thus fall within the definition of \"consumer credit\" under the Code.",

        "question": "HOW LONG CAN A CRA RETAIN MY CREDIT DATA? IF I SETTLE MY LOAN ACCOUNT, WILL MY CREDIT DATA HELD BY A CRA BE DELETED FROM ITS DATABASE?",
        "answer": "A CRA can retain your personal particulars and **account general data** for credit reporting purposes as long as you have a borrowing relationship with a credit provider.\n\n \n\nThe general rule on data retention is that **account repayment data** may be retained for 5 years from the date of the creation of such data, or until the expiry of a period of 5 years from the date of the termination of the account. However, there are certain exceptions. For example, if you have defaulted on repayment for a period in excess of 60 days, then account data relating to the default may be retained for a period of 5 years following the date on which the amount in default was fully settled.\n\n \n\n(Note: \"Account general data\" include the loan amount/credit limit, identity of the credit provider, and the dates on which the account was opened & closed. \"Account repayment data\" include the amount of payment made during the last reporting period, the outstanding balance, and any amount past due (overdue amount). For more details, please refer to schedule 2 of the [Code issued by the PCPD](https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/data_privacy_law/code_of_practices/files/CCDCode_2013_e.pdf).)\n\n \n\nWhen you settle your loan account, you have the right to instruct your credit provider to make a request to the CRA to delete the closed account data from its database. Your credit provider should have informed you of this right at the time when you applied for the loan. Alternatively, you should receive a written reminder from that company upon your settlement of the account.\n\n \n\nHowever, you should note that the right to request deletion of the data is conditional upon there having been, within the 5 years immediately before the termination of the account, no default in repayment lasting for a period of more than 60 days, AND the account having been settled by full repayment. You should also note that your credit provider may at its own discretion retain your closed account data in its own system for internal accounting purposes even though you have requested deletion of the data from the CRA's database.",

If you subsequently apply for loans from other banks, your closed account information (with no record of late repayments) can put you in a stronger position to negotiate better terms of credit.",

I ALSO HAVE A CREDIT CARD WITH THE SAME BANK FOR MANY YEARS UP TO NOW. CAN MY BANK PROVIDE DATA CONCERNING ALL THESE ACCOUNTS TO THE CRA AFTER 2 JUNE 2003?",
        "answer": "Your bank may provide the CRA with data regarding any account (credit or loan account) which involves a current borrowing relationship, even if there is no default in repayment.\n\n \n\nHowever, the bank is not allowed to report data relating to any account that had been settled by full repayment prior to 2 June 2003. As regards an account that remains active after 2 June 2003, the bank cannot report past repayment data (that existed prior to 2 June 2003) unless there is an outstanding default on the account on 2 June 2003, in which case, the bank can report such default data. (Note: \"Outstanding default\" means an overdue amount that has not yet been settled.)\n\n \n\nIn your case, since you fully repaid your tax loan before 2 June 2003, the bank is not allowed to report the loan account data to the CRA. As regards your credit card account, provided you have no current outstanding default in any repayment, your past payment transactions (that occurred before 2 June 2003) will not be reported by your bank. However, if you only made the minimum repayment according to the monthly credit card statements before 2 June 2003, the remaining portion after each monthly due date may be outstanding default.

It is incumbent upon you to provide evidence of your discharge from bankruptcy (either a certificate of discharge issued by the Court of First Instance of the High Court, or a written notice from the Official Receiver) to the CRA.

If this is feasible, the security staff should not collect your ID card number. If such monitoring is not feasible, they are allowed to collect your ID card number.\n\n \n\nHowever, the security staff should take appropriate security measures to ensure that such entries in a visitors' log book are concealed from subsequent visitors who enter their details. If you are unwilling to provide your ID card number, you can suggest other alternatives. Examples of such alternatives include identification by another identification document (e.g. a staff card), or identification by someone known to the security staff (e.g. by a resident in the case of a residential building).\n\n \n\nIt is recommended by PCPD that in normal circumstances, entries in the visitor log book can be retained for a period of not more than one month. If there are any valid grounds justifying a longer retention period (e.g. where the records are required for evidentiary purposes or to assist a police investigation of detected or reported unlawful activities), the security staff can retain the data for more than one month.

        "question": "WHAT SHOULD I BE AWARE OF BEFORE I PROVIDE MY ID CARD NUMBER OR ID CARD COPY TO OTHER PERSONS?",
        "answer": "The Code requires organizations or persons (the data users), before recording an ID card number, to consider alternatives that are less privacy intrusive. If you are not happy about a request to provide your ID card number, suggest to the requestor/data user alternatives that are reasonable and acceptable to you. For example, try to arrange for identification of yourself by someone else who is already known to the organization. **An organization may be contravening the Code if it refuses to accept an alternative without a good explanation** .\n\n \n\nCompared to ID card numbers, stricter limits are imposed on the collection of ID card copies because of the greater dangers they carry in relation to possible fraud or other misuse. Generally speaking, this gives you greater justification in querying a request to provide a copy of your ID card.\n\n \n\nThe Code generally requires the data users to mark photocopies of ID cards they keep with the word \"copy\". This marking should be made across the entire image of the ID card. The only exception to this marking requirement you are likely to encounter is where the photocopy is going to be converted into some other form, e.g. microfilm.\n\n \n\nIf you provide a photocopy of your ID card in person to a data user, you can insist that it must be marked \"copy\" in your presence.\n\n \n\nUnless otherwise required or permitted by law, data users should ensure that an ID card number and the name of the holder are not displayed together publicly.\n\n \n\nOne common situation in which a breach of the above requirement may occur is the publication of notices including individuals' names and ID card numbers in a newspaper (e.g. notices carrying the result of a lucky draw or a competition). Another is the display of notices containing individuals' names and ID card numbers on a notice board in places such as a school, an office, or the lobby of a residential building. A further one is the inadvertent disclosure of the names and ID card numbers of visitors to subsequent visitors to a building in a visitors' log-book.\n\n \n\nWhere you encounter a situation such as those described above, ask the organization/data user to stop displaying or disclosing those data (or else to justify the display/disclosure). An organization is likely to have contravened the Code if it cannot provide good justification.",

In other words, other personal identifiers may be collected only under the circumstances and by the means permitted for ID card numbers and are subject to similar requirements as regards retention and use.\n\n \n\nHowever, the above does not apply to the collection or use of such other personal identifiers for a purpose that is directly related to the functions and activities of the person that assigned the identifier to the individuals concerned. For example, a staff number may be collected and used for purposes directly related to the functions or activities of the employer that assigned the number, such as managing employee records and the payment of employee salaries.\n\n \n\nData users that assign personal identifiers to individuals should take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure the security of the system under which this is done. Such steps should include security measures to safeguard against the unauthorized assignment of the identifier or production of any document (e.g. the unauthorized production of a staff card with a false staff number printed on it).",

        "answer": "Generally speaking, an employer must not collect a copy of the identity card of a job applicant during the recruitment process unless and until the individual has accepted an offer of employment.\n\n \n\nPersonal data of unsuccessful applicants (bearing in mind possible discrimination claims or complaints that may be lodged by an aggrieved applicant) can be retained for a period of up to two years from the date of rejecting the applicants, and must then be destroyed. The data can be retained for a longer period if there is a subsisting reason that obliges the employer to do so (e.g. to fulfill a legal obligation), or the applicants have given their consent for the data to be retained beyond two years.",

For example, would selective/random checking, rather than continuous monitoring, be effective and sufficient for the employers' purposes? Can the monitoring measures be confined to areas of high risk? If employers plan to use CCTV, can the camera recording be only confined to selected areas instead of all areas of the company?\n\n \n\nAs a general rule, employee monitoring should be conducted in an open/overt manner. Covert monitoring (e.g. using hidden \"pinhole\" cameras) should not be adopted unless it is justified by the existence of special circumstances (e.g. a reasonable suspicion that an unlawful activity is about to be committed or has been committed by certain employees).\n\n \n\nEmployers who have decided to monitor employees at work should accept responsibility and be accountable for proper conduct when carrying out their monitoring activities.

        "question": "SHOULD EMPLOYERS NOTIFY THEIR EMPLOYEES BEFORE COMMENCING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED WORK MONITORING MEASURES? HOW SHOULD EMPLOYERS MANAGE THE DATA COLLECTED?",
        "answer": "Employers should inform their employees of any monitoring policy. It is good practice to prepare a comprehensive written privacy policy/employee monitoring policy and release it to the employees, preferably before any monitoring begins. As recommended by the PCPD, such policy should explicitly refer to the following matters:\n\n \n\n- the business purpose(s) that employee monitoring seeks to fulfill;\n- the circumstances under which monitoring may take place and the manner in which monitoring may be conducted;\n- the kinds of personal data that may be collected in the course of monitoring; and\n- the purpose(s) for which the personal data collected may be used.\n\nAn example of a privacy policy statement concerning e-mail monitoring is provided in Appendix I of the [Privacy Guidelines – Monitoring and Personal Data Privacy at Work ](https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/data_privacy_law/code_of_practices/files/Monitoring_and_Personal_Data_Privacy_At_Work_revis_Eng.pdf)(which is published by the PCPD).\n\n \n\nUnless an employer has obtained the express consent of an employee (and the consent is given voluntarily), or unless there is an applicable exemption provided for under the law, an employee's personal data collected by monitoring measures can only be used for the purposes stated in the employee monitoring policy, or for a directly related purpose.\n\n \n\nPersonal data collected should not be kept any longer than is necessary for fulfilling the stipulated purpose. For example, recorded information contained on CCTV tapes should be routinely erased according to a pre-determined schedule. A longer retention period may be appropriate in special circumstances (e.g., where the recorded information is required for evidentiary purposes in legal or disciplinary proceedings).\n\n \n\nEmployers should also implement security and access control measures to safeguard the protection of the personal data collected. For example, CCTV tapes should be securely locked in a storage facility located in a controlled access area.",

        "question": "CAN I INSTALL A VIDEO CAMERA AT HOME TO MONITOR MY DOMESTIC HELPER?",
        "answer": "The PCPD issued the document [Monitoring and Personal Data Privacy at Work: Points to Note for Employers of Domestic Helpers](https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/data_privacy_law/code_of_practices/files/points_to_note_15102015_e.pdf) in December 2004 and revised the same in October 2015. The following provides a summary of this publication for your reference.\n\n \n\nThe use of video cameras to monitor domestic helpers' activities is in general an intrusion of privacy. Before using this monitoring method, employers must seriously consider whether it is necessary to do so, and whether there are alternative means available. In the event of a complaint made to the PCPD, the alleged employers may be called upon to explain and prove the initial evidence or suspicion which justifies the use of video monitoring.\n\n \n\nIf you decide to implement video monitoring at home, you should note 3 important points: reasonableness of the monitoring practice, openness of the monitoring practice, and use and retention of video records.\n\n \n\n**a) Reasonableness of the monitoring practice**\n\n \n\nEmployers should conduct the monitoring in an overt/open manner unless there are special circumstances which justify the use of covert/secret means (e.g. use of hidden \"pinhole\" cameras). The existence of the following situations may justify covert monitoring:\n\n \n\n- there is a reasonable suspicion that a child or an elderly person has suffered (or is likely to suffer) from abuse or neglect, e.g. there are signs of unexplained injuries found on the body of that person, or where abnormal behaviours are observed in the domestic helper;\n- it is highly likely that the suspected abuse occurred at home; and\n- there is no realistic alternative to obtaining evidence of these abusive acts other than by way of covert monitoring.\n\nHowever, employers should note that no cameras (whether hidden or not) should capture images showing activities inside the private area where the domestic helper rests after work.\n\n \n\n**b) Openness of the monitoring practice**\n\n \n\nIt is important that domestic helpers be notified of the presence of any video monitoring system in the premises where they work. This notification should not be omitted except in very exceptional situations such as to collect evidence of abuse based on reasonable suspicion. The PCPD recommends that a written notification should be given instead of an oral one.\n\n \n\nEmployers are reminded that such notification does not confer upon them a legal right to adopt employee monitoring under all circumstances nor does it release them from their obligations under the Ordinance to observe the [six data protection principles](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/personalDataPrivacy/6_data_protection_principles/).\n\n \n\n**c) Use and retention of video records**\n\n \n\nEmployers must ensure that video records are only used for the purposes stated in the notification given to domestic helpers or a directly related purpose, unless otherwise permitted by law.\n\n \n\nThe PCPD recommends that video records which contain the personal data of domestic helpers be retained for not more than 7 days. A longer retention period may be considered if the recorded data are required for evidentiary purposes (e.g. to assist an investigation conducted by the PCPD or the police).",

It is possible that a site appears to be at an electronic address that does not belong to it. Visit the \"About the Organization\" page and check the organization's identity details such as its name, physical location, and contact telephone/fax number. An organization may be considered as using unfair means to collect personal data if it does not disclose its identity (in which case it might have contravened [data protection principle 1](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/personalDataPrivacy/6_data_protection_principles/)).\n\n \n\nLook for the site's privacy policy notice.

        "answer": "There is no specific provision under the Ordinance which confers an individual the right to request a data user to delete his personal data as he may wish. Thus, the service provider would not have contravened the requirements under the Ordinance by refusing your request.\n\n \n\nHowever, the service provider has to comply with the requirements under DPP2(2) and section 26(1) of the Ordinance:\n\n \n\n- DPP2(2) stipulates that personal data shall not be kept longer than is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose (including any directly related purpose) for which the data is or is to be used;\n\n \n\n- Section 26(1) requires a data user to erase personal data held when the data is no longer required for the purpose (including any directly related purpose) for which the data was used unless (a) any such erasure is prohibited under any law; or (b) it is in the public interest (including historical interest) for the data not to be erased.\n\n \n\nThus, if your personal data held by that service provider can no longer be used to fulfill and/or has already fulfilled that purpose (including any directly related purpose) for which the data can be collected, the service provider should erase your data unless the retention of data is in accordance with the statutory requirements or is in the public interest.\n\n \n\nYou may also consider making enquiries with the service provider on its retention policy so as to understand if it has retained your personal data longer than necessary.",

        "question": "WHEN CAN I MAKE A CLAIM FOR PERSONAL INJURY?",
        "answer": "You may claim compensation for personal injury through legal action in Hong Kong when you have suffered injuries as the victim of an accident that was caused by the fault of a party other than yourself. A legal action for personal injury is a civil lawsuit that is directed at compensating a victim who suffers bodily injury due to an accident that is caused by a wrongdoer. It does not impose criminal liability for punishing the wrongdoer*.*\n\n \n\nThe mere fact that an accident occurred is not by itself sufficient to prove that the defendant has been negligent. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff (in this case the person injured) to show that on the balance of probability, the accident was caused by the fault (negligence) of the defendant(s). The burden of proof of liability for a personal injury claim may be based on a number of causes of action. \n\n \n\nThese \"causes\" include negligence, trespass on a person (such as physical attack), nuisance, breach of a statutory duty, and breach of a contractual duty. You can also claim for monetary compensation against a person who has deliberately injured you. However, if the accident did not involve someone's fault or negligence, then there is no cause of action under personal injury proceedings, and you will not be able to sue anyone for compensation.",

        "question": "HOW TO MAKE A CLAIM FOR PERSONAL INJURIES?",
        "answer": "It is important to bear in mind that generally the time allowed for submitting a personal injury claim to the Court is limited to three years from the date of the accident. If you do not commence proceedings within the 3 year time limit, you will lose your right to sue.\n\n \n\nHere are some practical tips for preparing your claim for personal injuries:-\n\n \n\n- After being involved in an accident in which you have suffered injuries, the first step required is to call the police and ambulance services. Tell the doctor about all the injuries that you have suffered.\n- Keep a record of all ailments that occur following an accident.\n- You should take a number of steps at the scene of the accident that caused your injury to gather evidence that can be used to substantiate your claim, as you will need to prove that the injury occurred as the result of someone else’s action.\n- Take a picture or draw a sketch of the scene if possible.\n- Collect the contact details of any person who witnessed the accident and notify them that they will be contacted at a later date.\n- A record of the accident, including the place where it occurred, the date and time, the personal details of any witnesses, and details of the parties involved, will all be required when filing a personal injury claim.\n- If the personal injury has resulted in loss of work or has caused permanent personal damage like the loss of a limb, caused you to be confined to a bed or to require nursing services, these circumstances need to be taken into account.\n- Get a prognosis of your injury from a medical professional and keep all receipts relating to medical consultations. Collect payslips from before the accident, or other evidence of income that will prove a claim for loss of earnings if you are unable to work for a period as a result of your injuries.\n- Maintain all records of the accident and any costs borne for medical care, and loss of work. Note that in the case of a motoring accident, if the car was a write off, even the loss of the fuel it contained can be claimed.\n\nIf the amount of compensation that you want to claim is over HK$3,000,000 you need to start your action in the Court of First Instance of the High Court. Claims for an amount under HK$3,000,000 should be filed in District Court. Claims under HK$75,000 should be pursued in Small Claims Tribunal.\n\n \n\nIn all cases it is advisable to consult solicitors who are experienced in dealing with accident compensation claims, and they will advise whether or not your intended claims have any merit, that is, whether or not there are reasonable grounds for your claim. Your solicitor will be able to organise your evidence in order to present it to the party being held responsible and their insurers. Please note that if records of the accident have not been properly kept, or are incomplete, this can be a big drawback in substantiating your claim.",

        "answer": "It is difficult to provide exact figures as regards how much compensation a successful claim for a personal injury would bring because each case is different in circumstances and no one case will be exactly the same as another.\n\n \n\nIn general terms a compensation claim for personal injury will be calculated by taking into account the past and future financial cost caused by the injuries sustained in the accident, the pain and suffering that was caused as a result, and the interest that has accrued from the time that the proceedings were served. The court would also consider any amount payable from the financial loss attributable to the injuries caused by the accident and legal costs.\n\n \n\nThe main objective of compensation is to place the claimant (person making the claim) in the position that they would have enjoyed had the accident not occurred, insofar as monetary compensation can achieve this. The usual remedies include :\n\n \n\n- [For a non-fatal claim](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/personalInjuries/7_How_much_could_my_claim_be_worth/For_a_non_fatal_claim/)\n- [For a fatal claim](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/personalInjuries/7_How_much_could_my_claim_be_worth/For_a_fatal_claim/)\n\n \n\nIt is recommended that you consult a lawyer for a detailed explanation of how to organize and proceed with a claim for damages.",

IS THE LEGAL PROCEDURE FOR MY CLAIM AGAINST MY EMPLOYER FOR EMPLOYEES' COMPENSATION DIFFERENT FROM THE PROCEDURE FOR A PERSONAL INJURY CLAIM IN RESPECT OF THE SAME INJURY?](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/personalInjuries/13_Questions_and_answers/Q1)\n\n## 1. I WAS INJURED AT WORK. IS THE LEGAL PROCEDURE FOR MY CLAIM AGAINST MY EMPLOYER FOR EMPLOYEES' COMPENSATION DIFFERENT FROM THE PROCEDURE FOR A PERSONAL INJURY CLAIM IN RESPECT OF THE SAME INJURY?",
        "answer": "For work-related injuries, the legal procedure for employees' compensation is governed by the [Employees' Compensation Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/) ([Cap. 282](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/)) which is not the same as in personal injury cases, as described above.\n\n \n\nWhere any injury is caused to an employee by the negligence, breach of statutory duty or other wrongful act or omission of the employer and any other person or entity, the injured employee may also bring separate common law claims for damages independently from an employee's compensation claim under the [ECO](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/282/).",

However, any damages that are awarded against an employer in an action under common law or under any enactment in respect of any such negligence, breach of statutory duty, or wrongful act or omission, shall be reduced by the value of any compensation that has been received by the injured employee under their employees' compensation claims.",

In this scenario, it would be advisable for the claimant to commence proceedings against the waiter and the employer of the waiter. Generally, the employer would be vicariously liable for a negligent act of the waiter that was performed in the course of the waiter’s normal employment duties.\n\n \n\nYou are advised to consult a lawyer before deciding on the appropriate parties to sue.",

In other words, the occupier may not be able to escape from liability if the relevant warning sign / warning notice / verbal warning announcement was not clear and adequate with regard to the whole situation.",

Contributory negligence is a point for the defendant to raise, not you, and the burden is on the defendant to establish the existence of your contributory negligence.\n\n \n\nWhere any person suffers damage partly due to his own fault and partly due to the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just having regard to the claimant's share of the responsibility for the damage. Contributory negligence is often expressed as a percentage based on the plaintiff’s share of the responsibility for the injury.",

Where a Grant of Letters of Administration or Probate has been issued, particulars, such as the date of the Grant, the Grant number and the details of the executor/administrator of the deceased's estate must also be provided in the Statement of Claim.\n\n \n\nNon-financial losses and financial losses that have been incurred between the date of the accident and the date of death can be claimed against the defendant. Financial losses include medical expenses, funeral expenses and loss of future accumulation of wealth. A claim may be made by the deceased's dependents (such as the children or the spouse) for loss of dependency. A claim for non-financial losses, such as bereavement (mental depression/suffering due to the death of a relative), may also be brought by the deceased's relatives.\n\n \n\nThe names and dates of birth of the deceased and the person who wants to seek compensation must be written in the Statement of Claim.

When an individual is unable to look after his own interests or manage his own lawsuit, the court would appoint a person to represent that individual's legal interests. In court terminology this person is called a next friend. A next friend is not a party to a lawsuit but an officer of the court. When the lawsuit is concluded, the next friend's duty ends.

        "question": "UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES COULD THE CRIMINAL RECORD BE DELETED?",
        "answer": "Once a person has been convicted of a criminal offence, the criminal record cannot be deleted from the police or court files (unless the offender successfully appealed against the conviction). However, under [section 2](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/297/s2.html) of the [Rehabilitation of Offenders Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/297/) ([Cap. 297](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/297/)) , if a person who has not previously committed any offence before that person is convicted of an offence and is not sentenced to imprisonment exceeding three months or a fine exceeding $10,000, that person's conviction record will be considered as \"spent\" if he has not re-offended within a period of three years.\n\n \n\nThe effect of a spent conviction is that in general that person should be regarded as not having been convicted of the offence. Hence, if that person is asked by his potential employer or other person whether he has committed any offence before, he can simply say \"No\". He cannot be dismissed by his employer on the ground that he did not disclose his criminal record or on the ground that he has a conviction.\n\n \n\nHowever, this spent conviction scheme is subject to a number of exceptions. For example, it does not apply if that person wants to apply for some high ranking jobs in the Government or if he wants to become a lawyer, accountant, an insurance broker or the director of a licensed bank (see [sections 3](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/297/s3.html) and [4](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/297/s4.html) of the [Rehabilitation of Offenders Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/297/) for further details of the exceptions). Moreover, if that person applies for a Certificate of No Criminal Conviction from the police for emigration purposes, the police will still disclose such criminal record in the Certificate with a note that the relevant conviction is regarded as spent under Hong Kong Law.",

        "question": "WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES IF I REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH THE POLICE WHEN THEY ARE EXERCISING THEIR POWERS TO STOP, QUESTION OR SEARCH ME?",
        "answer": "It first depends on whether or not the police have proper legal basis to do the act concerned (see the earlier Q&As as to the circumstances when the police can lawfully stop, question or search a person). If not, then the police officers concerned are not acting in due execution of their duties, and one may refuse to cooperate. If yes, then one must in general cooperate with the police, as it is an offence for a person to assault, resist or deliberately obstruct the police in the execution of their lawful duties (see for example, [section 63](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/232/s63) of the [Police Force Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/232) and [section 36](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/212/s36) of the [Offences Against The Person Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/212)). The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment of two years.\n\n \n\nMoreover, any Hong Kong resident aged 15 or above who without reasonable excuse fails to produce proof of identity (showing his ID card or passport) for inspection by the police upon demand commits an offence and is liable to a fine of $5,000 ([section 17C](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/115/s17c) of the [Immigration Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/115)).\n\n \n\nHowever, even if the police can lawfully ask you questions, you have a right to silence and so may refuse to answer any questions posed by the police (except that you may need to provide your name and address to the police).",

        "answer": "If the situation allows, the police should try to conduct the search in a more private or discreet place. You may also request the police to carry out the search at the nearest police station. However, the law in general gives the police a wide discretion to decide where the search is to be conducted in a particular case. The police officers may therefore insist on conducting the search on you in public despite your request, if they have reason to do so (e.g. they suspect that you may have weapons).",

        "question": "WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS IF I AM BEING ARRESTED?",
        "answer": "First, you have a right to be informed by the police officer of the reason for arresting you. If the police officer fails to tell you the reason at the time of the arrest, the arrest is generally unlawful. If, however, you try to run away or the situation is such that it is impractical for the officer to tell you the reason, then the officer may inform you the reason at a later time after the arrest.\n\n \n\nSecondly, you have a right to silence. Immediately after the arrest, the police must inform you of your right to remain silent. The police officer will caution you by saying, \"You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but whatever you say will be put into writing and may be given in evidence.\" You may therefore choose whether or not to answer any questions posed by the police (except that you may need to provide your name and address to the police).\n\n \n\nYou should also note that under [section 101A](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221/s101a) of the [Criminal Procedure Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/221/), any person effecting an arrest may use such force as is reasonable. What constitutes reasonable force depends on the circumstances. A police officer may, for example, employ handcuffs or other means of restraint where it is necessary to prevent escape. [Section 50(2)](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/232/s50) of the [Police Force Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/232) also allows the police officer to use all means necessary to effect an arrest if the suspect forcibly resists or attempts to evade the arrest.",

This period can be extended to 72 hours if a warrant for arrest and detention in respect of [deportation](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary) is applied for.\n\n \n\nIf the police want to detain you for a longer period, they must first bring you before a Magistrate and make the relevant application.

        "answer": "In general, the rights of a person under detention are set out in a document called \"Notice to Persons in Custody\". This document should be prominently displayed inside any interview room of a police station. The police should also explain to the detained person the basic contents of this document before the interview, and should give a copy to the detained person. The detained person's rights include:\n\n \n\n- Requesting that the detained person's relatives or a friend be informed of the detention;\n- Communicating and consulting with a legal adviser (unless any unreasonable delay or hindrance will likely be caused to the processes of investigation or the administration of justice);\n- Asking to be released on bail;\n- Being provided with drinking water upon request, adequate food and refreshment as well as medical care if necessary.\n\n \n\nThe questioning of the detained person may be carried out by way of a video-taped interview (“VRI”) (depending on the circumstances so required). It is worth noticing that you are entitled to refuse to participate in a VRI. The police have their prescribed forms that suspects are invited to sign to confirm whether or not they consent to a VRI. If you do not consent to a VRI, the police can still interview you, but with the traditional method of recording the interview in writing. Before taking a statement from the detained person, the police officer must caution that person as set out above (please refer to [Question 2 of Part E](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/policeAndCrime/police_powers/powers_of_arrest/my_rights)). You may choose whether or not to answer any question asked by the police, as you have a right to silence. You may also request to obtain legal advice before deciding whether or not to answer any questions. You may also have your lawyer present during the questioning and taking of any statement. If you choose to answer any of the police officer's questions, all the questions and answers will be written down as a \"Record of Interview\" (often referred to as a \"cautioned statement\"). Upon conclusion of the interview the police have an obligation to provide you with a copy of this Record of Interview.",

        "answer": "You should first ask the police whether you can be released on bail. The police should grant bail to an accused person unless the alleged offence is serious or there is other good reason to detain the accused. Bail will usually be granted subject to a cash deposit or conditions of [recognizance](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary#r). The police will direct the accused to return to the police station or to appear in court on a specified date.\n\n \n\nIf bail is not granted by the police, then the police will have a duty to bring the accused to the Magistrates' Court as soon as practicable (normally in the following morning). The accused may apply to the Magistrate for bail at the first hearing. If bail is refused by the Magistrate, the accused may apply to a judge of the Court of First Instance of High Court for the grant of bail.\n\n \n\nBail should generally be granted by the court unless there is substantial ground for believing that the accused will fail to appear at the next scheduled hearing, or commit other offences whilst on bail, or interfere with witnesses or the investigation. For more details on this matter, please refer to [section 9D](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221/s9d) and [section 9G](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221/s9g) of the [Criminal Procedure Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221).",

These rights include:\n\n \n\n- Requesting that the detained person's relatives or a friend be informed of the detention;\n- Communicating and consulting with a legal adviser (unless unreasonable delay or hindrance will likely be caused to the processes of investigation or the administration of justice);\n- Asking to be released on bail;\n- **Being provided with drinking water upon request, adequate food and refreshment as well as medical care if necessary.**\n\nDetailed contents of the Notice to Persons Detained can be found [here](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/reg/204A/s17.html).\n\n \n\nAn arrested person may be released from custody on the deposit of a reasonable sum of money. The amount of such a sum is determined by a Senior Commission Against Corruption Officer or an officer of higher rank. A person may also be released on bail by providing such [recognizance](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary), with such sureties, as the senior officer deems necessary. Persons released on bail must further attend the offices of the ICAC as specified or appear before a M agistrate as required. Failure to attend will result in the forfeiture of the deposited sum or recognizance.\n\n \n\nIf bail is refused, the detained person must be brought before a Magistrate as soon as practicable and in any event within 48 hours after arrest.\n\n \n\n**Questioning and Interviewing by ICAC officers**\n\n \n\nThe questioning of the detained person is usually done by the ICAC officers by way of a video-taped interview. Before questioning and interviewing the detained person, the ICAC officers must caution that person by saying, \"You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but whatever you say will be put into writing and may be given in evidence.\" The detained person has a right to remain silent, and may therefore choose whether or not to attend the video-taped interview or answer any questions posed by the ICAC officers . The detained person may also request to obtain legal advice before deciding whether or not to answer any questions. The detained person may also have his lawyer present during the questioning and taking of any statement. Upon conclusion of the interview , the ICAC officers must provide the interviewee with a copy of the taped interview or the written statement (as the case may be).",

        "question": "I WILL ATTEND A COURT HEARING SOON. WHAT IS THE PROCEDURE DURING A CRIMINAL HEARING?",
        "answer": "**Due to the complexity of criminal procedures and the risk of conviction, you are strongly recommended to appoint a lawyer to represent you.**\n\n \n\nThe following chart briefly sets out normal court procedure in a criminal case:\n\n \n\n| ![01](https://clic.org.hk/sites/default/files/inline-images/court_procedure_01.jpg) |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| ![02](https://clic.org.hk/sites/default/files/inline-images/court_procedure_02.jpg) |\n| ![03](https://clic.org.hk/sites/default/files/inline-images/court_procedure_03.jpg) |\n| ![04](https://clic.org.hk/sites/default/files/inline-images/court_procedure_04.jpg) |\n| ![05](https://clic.org.hk/sites/default/files/inline-images/court_procedure_05.jpg) |\n| ![06](https://clic.org.hk/sites/default/files/inline-images/court_procedure_06.jpg) |\n| ![07](https://clic.org.hk/sites/default/files/inline-images/court_procedure_07.jpg) |\n| ![08](https://clic.org.hk/sites/default/files/inline-images/court_procedure_08.jpg) |\n\n**First Hearing**\n\n \n\nNo matter how serious the offence is, the [accused person](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/policeAndCrime/court_procedure/) will in general be brought to a Magistrates’ Court to attend the first hearing. If the prosecution needs further time to investigate or seek legal advice, or if the prosecution decides to transfer the case for trial in the District Court or the Court of First Instance of the High Court, then the prosecutor will seek an adjournment (to postpone the hearing). Otherwise, the charge is read to the accused person at the first hearing, who is then asked to plead guilty or not guilty to the offence. If the accused person pleads not guilty, then the case will usually be adjourned to another date for trial.\n\n \n\nUpon adjournment of the case, the accused person may apply to the Magistrate for bail. Bail should generally be granted by the Magistrate unless there is substantial ground for believing that the accused will fail to appear at the next scheduled hearing, or commit other offences whilst on bail, or interfere with witnesses or the investigation. The accused person has the right to submit an application for bail on further appearances before the Magistrate if bail was refused at the previous hearing(s). He may also apply to the Court of First Instance of the High Court for bail upon refusal by the Magistrate. For more details on this matter, please refer to [section 9D](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221/s9d)and [section 9G](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221/s9g) of the [Criminal Procedure Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221).\n\n \n\n**Plea of Guilty (the accused admits guilt)**\n\n \n\nThe accused person who pleads guilty is not yet convicted of the offence until he is formally convicted by the Court. On a plea of guilty, the brief facts of the case on which the accused is to be convicted will be read in open court. If the accused agrees with the brief facts, then the Court will formally convict him (unless the Court is not satisfied that the agreed brief facts show the commission of the offence). Where the accused does not agree with the prosecution's brief facts (or part of them), the Court will hear evidence from the prosecution and the accused to decide the facts. Such a hearing is called a “Newton Hearing”. After the Court has made a decision on the facts, it will formally convict the accused (unless the Court is not satisfied that the decided facts show the commission of the offence).\n\n \n\nUpon conviction, the prosecution will inform the Court the relevant background of the accused person in particular whether he has any previous criminal records. The Court will then allow the accused person or his lawyer to tell the Court matters which may persuade the Court to impose a more lenient sentence. This process is called a **plea in mitigation** . The Court may then pass a sentence (i.e. decide the penalty) on the accused person or it may call for some reports (e.g. probation report, Community Service Order report or psychiatric report etc) before it decides the proper sentence.",

        "question": "I HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIMINAL ACTS (E.G. STOLEN A WATCH, WOUNDED A PERSON OR WHATEVER) AND I HAVE TOLD MY LAWYER ALL THE FACTS. HOWEVER, I DO NOT WANT TO PLEAD GUILTY TO THE OFFENCE. WILL MY LAWYER STILL DEFEND ME AT TRIAL, OR ONLY SAY SOMETHING IN MITIGATION? IS MY LAWYER BOUND TO REPORT MY OFFENCE TO THE COURT AFTER I TELL HIM THE TRUTH?",
        "answer": "You have the right to plead NOT guilty even if you have committed the criminal acts. You also have the right to legal representation in that situation. Under the Hong Kong legal system, the burden is on the prosecution to provide satisfactory evidence to the Court to prove that you are guilty of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, your lawyer may still defend you on the basis that the prosecution cannot satisfy this burden of proof by testing the prosecution's evidence. However, your lawyer must also follow some professional ethics and he can only run your defence on a limited basis, as he cannot conduct your defence on a basis that is contrary to what you have told him. For example, your lawyer can challenge a prosecution witness's memory, but he cannot put forward a defence that you were not present at the scene of crime or that it is another person who committed the offence.\n\n \n\nWhile you have the right not to plead guilty and ask your lawyer to continue to defend you, you should consult your lawyer whether it is in your best interest to do so. Given what you have told your lawyer, he can only run your defence on a rather limited basis, and this may affect the chance of a successful defence. If you are convicted by the Court after trial, you will not receive the normal one-third discount on sentencing upon a guilty plea. You should therefore carefully consider whether you wish to plead guilty to the charge and ask your lawyer to mitigate on your behalf.\n\n \n\nAll information that you have told your lawyer would be kept strictly confidential. Without your consent, your lawyer cannot tell the Court or others that you have committed the criminal acts. Hence, you should be honest and truthful with your lawyer so that he can give you the proper legal advice.",

By virtue of that right, you are generally not required to give evidence at trial.\n\n \n\nIn deciding whether or not to give evidence, your lawyer should advise you of the advantages and disadvantages of giving evidence. In some cases, it may be necessary for you to give evidence or call witnesses, e.g. where you have an \"alibi\" (evidence showing that you were not at the scene of the crime when the crime happened). On the other hand, if you choose to give evidence, you run the risk that you may weaken your own defence during cross-examination by the prosecution. The prosecution may be able to weaken your credibility if you answer the questions poorly or inconsistently.",

        "answer": "If it is an accident and there is no evidence that you have any intention to injure that lady, then you will not be charged with murder or manslaughter. However, if the accident occurred as a result of your serious fault in driving, then you may be charged with dangerous driving causing death under [section 36](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/374/s36.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/374/) of the Laws of Hong Kong). A person is considered to be driving dangerously if the way that person drives falls far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver, and it would be obvious to the competent and careful driver that driving in such a way would be dangerous. It is also dangerous driving where it would be obvious to the competent and careful driver that the motor vehicle's condition was so bad that it would be dangerous to drive such a vehicle. The offence of dangerous driving causing death carries a penalty of a fine (of up to HK$50,000) and imprisonment for up to ten years. Such a driver shall also be disqualified from driving for a period of not less than two years for the first such offence, and not less than three years for any subsequent offences.\n\n \n\nIf you were only careless at that time, then you may be charged with careless driving under [section 38](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/374/s38.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/374/). A person is considered to be driving carelessly if that person drives without due care and attention i.e. failing to exercise the degree of care and attention that a reasonable, competent and prudent driver would exercise. A person is also considered to be driving carelessly where that person drives without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road.

        "answer": "As stated in [Question 6](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/policeAndCrime/police_powers/powers_of_arrest/notify_parents), the police is under a duty to make reasonable efforts to locate and inform the parent(s) or guardian(s) of an arrested young person. Where they are unable to get in contact with you, you should consider contacting your lawyer as soon as possible. You can also consider contacting the relevant police station (for instance, the police station close to the area where the incident happened) to make enquiries.",

        "question": "CAN I LEAVE HONG KONG AFTER BEING ARRESTED?",
        "answer": "It depends on your conditions of bail and the agency by which you are arrested. For instance, if you are arrested by ICAC, according to a [section 17A](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/201/s17a) of [Prevention of Bribery Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/201) ([Cap. 201](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/201)), a magistrate may, on the application ex parte of the Commissioner, require a person under investigation to surrender any travel document in his/her possession. But if you are arrested by other law enforcement authorities like the police, generally speaking, as long as you can make sure to come back on time to report bail in accordance with the police’s requirement, you can still leave Hong Kong after being arrested.",

You are free to decide whether you wish to assist on a voluntary basis, and you may choose to leave at any time.

During questioning, the police must observe the Rules and Directions for Questioning of Suspects and Taking Statements and any breach will be taken into account when deciding whether cautioned statements are admissible as evidence.\n\n \n\nAt all times you have the right to representation and legal advice prior to and during the interview.

The suspect, along with 8 actors that roughly resemble the suspect (e.g. in terms of age, height, ethnicity, etc.), will be placed in a one-way viewer room. Then, the witness should make every effort to identify the suspect with due consideration and certainty. The witness can also request the actors and the suspect to have words and phrases uttered for voice identification. Note that the witness will neither contact nor see any of them in any way prior to the ID parade, and the officer shall not make any suggestion or implication of the suspect’s identity to the witness. The process of ID parades is usually video recorded, and the suspect has the right to have a legal representation present at the parade.",

The charge sheet will normally include the location of the police station, name of the OC Case (officer in charge of the case), interpreter’s name (if applicable), language/dialect, time and date and the name of the defendant. After reading out the charge, the officer will ask the defendant whether he/she understands and whether he/she wishes to say anything.\n\n \n\nAfter formally laying charge(s) against the defendant, the police will decide on the date of the first appearance in court and whether bail would be granted to him/her.

        "question": "IF I AM CONVICTED AND I WANT TO LODGE AN APPEAL, WHAT SHOULD I DO? CAN I APPEAL AGAINST THE CONVICTION OR SENTENCE OR BOTH?",
        "answer": "You can lodge an appeal against either or both the conviction and the sentence. You must however bear in mind the time limits for filing the appeal documents, and consider carefully whether or not you have proper grounds for the appeal. Extension of these time limits will only be given in special circumstances.\n\n \n\nFor an appeal against a Magistrate's decision, the time limit is **14 days from the date when the Magistrate passed the sentence,** and the appeal will be made to the Judge of the Court of First Instance of the High Court. Alternatively, you may within the 14 days' period apply to the Magistrate who convicted you for a review of his decision. If the review is unsuccessful, you may then appeal to the Judge of the Court of First Instance within 14 days from the review decision. \n\n \n\nFor an appeal against the decision of the District Court or the Court of First Instance, the time limit is **28 days** and the appeal goes to the Court of Appeal of the High Court. Technically, the Court of Appeal will first decide whether or not to grant leave (i.e. permission) to appeal before hearing the actual appeal. However, the Court of Appeal will often combine the application for leave and the actual appeal together at one hearing.\n\n \n\nYou are strongly advised to seek legal advice before making a decision regarding the appeal. If you proceed with an appeal without considering carefully, there is a possibility that you may be worsen off. For example, if you appeal against the sentence, the higher court which hears the appeal may impose a heavier sentence if it takes the view that the original sentence is too lenient. Moreover, if the Court of Appeal considers that the appeal is unmeritorious (or unreasonable), it has the power to order that certain period that the convicted offender spent in prison between his conviction and the appeal be disregarded in calculating his original sentence.",

In particular, if the appellant or the respondent would like to obtain the trial transcripts and to insert them to the appeal bundle, the court may direct the applicant to provide reasons in support of such kind of application.\n\n \n\nAn appeal judge may give directions on the timeframe for parties to file the perfected grounds of appeal and skeleton submissions. The judge may also direct \"for mention\" hearings to ensure the case is ready. When it is ready, a date will be fixed for hearing the leave to appeal.\n\n \n\nAfter hearing the appeal (or dealing with it on paper) the appeal judge(s) may dismiss or allow an appeal orally and / or reserve written judgment to be handed down or delivered on a date to be fixed.",

        "answer": "Yes. The common routes include:\n\n \n\n(1) Review under section 104 of the Magistrates' Ordinance\n\n \n\nThe Prosecution can request a review of a Magistrate's decision regarding this conviction. It is not an appeal but an application to reconsider the decision.\n\n \n\nProcedure-wise, the Prosecution must submit a written application within 14 days after the Magistrate's decision. If the review decision is unfavorable, the Prosecution can still appeal it under [section 105](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/227/s105) of the [Magistrates' Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/227).\n\n \n\n(2) Appeal by way of case stated\n\n \n\n*For section 105 of the Magistrates' Ordinance (for cases at the Magistrates' Court level):*\n\n \n\nThe Prosecution has the right to appeal a Magistrate's decision through a \"case stated\". When appealing through a case stated, the Prosecution argues that the Magistrate made a legal mistake or exceeded their authority. This type of appeal focuses on legal questions and does not involve reevaluating all the evidence. The Court of Final Appeal is limited to the information provided in the stated case and cannot consider additional arguments or issues.\n\n \n\nThe Prosecution must submit a written application within 14 days of the Magistrate's decision, using [Form 95 of the Magistrates (Forms) Rules (Cap. 227C)](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/reg/227C/sch0?hl=Forms relating to Appeals and Case Stated). However, the Prosecution cannot use this section to appeal against a Magistrate’s factual findings.\n\n \n\n*For section 84 of the District Court Ordinance* (for cases at the District Court level)*:*\n\n \n\nUnder this section, following an acquittal at the District Court, the Prosecution can use the appeal by way of case stated procedure to appeal to the Court of Appeal. This appeal must be on a **question of law** only against a verdict or an order of acquittal. The Prosecution can also use this section to appeal against an order quashing or dismissing a charge for any defect or lack of jurisdiction. \n\n \n\nThe Prosecution must apply for its appeal in writing to the Judge in the District Court within 7 clear days after the Court makes the acquittal order. Afterwards, under [section 84(c)](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/336/s84) of the [District Court Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/336), the Court of Appeal may:\n\n \n\n1. Dismiss the appeal;\n2. Reverse the verdict or order; or\n3. Give the relevant directions as it thinks fit.\n\n \n\n*For section 81DA of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (for specified cases at the Court of First Instance level):*\n\n \n\n[Section 81DA](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221/s81da) was added into the [Criminal Procedure Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221) in 2023. Before this addition, the Prosecution did not have the right to appeal against acquittals by way of case stated. However, this section only applies to acquittals concerning offences endangering national security that were decided without a jury.\n\n \n\nThe Prosecution’s appeal must only relate to matters of law. Generally speaking, the Prosecution must make its appeal application in writing to the Court of First Instance within 14 clear days after the verdict, requesting the Court of First Instance to state a case for the opinion of the Court of Appeal.\n\n \n\nAfterwards, the Court of First Instance must state the case, setting out:\n\n \n\n1. the facts and the grounds on which the acquittal was arrived at or given; and\n2. the grounds on which the acquittal is questioned.\n\n \n\n(3) Section 81D of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance\n\n \n\nIf a defendant is found not guilty after a jury trial at the Court of First Instance, the Secretary for Justice can refer a legal question to the Court of Appeal using [section 81D](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221/s81d) of the [Criminal Procedure Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221). The procedures for this method are set out in the [Criminal Procedure (Reference of Questions of Law) Rules](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/reg/221E) ([Cap. 221E](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/reg/221E)).\n\n \n\n(4) Appeal following release under section 81E of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance\n\n \n\nA defendant can be released from charges under [section 16](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221/s16) or [section 79G](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221/s79g) of the [Criminal Procedure Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221) or under [section 22](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/394/s22) of the [Complex Commercial Crimes Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/394) ([Cap. 394](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/394)). Essentially, these three provisions allow a defendant to apply for a discharge on the ground that the evidence available:\n\n \n\n1. being insufficient to establish a *prima facie* case against him for the offence(s) in question; or\n2. would not be sufficient for a jury properly to convict him.\n\n \n\nFollowing such an application by the defendant, the Court must evaluate this issue and make directions accordingly.\n\n \n\nHowever, the Secretary for Justice has the option to appeal the release to the Court of Appeal.\n\n \n\nThe Secretary for Justice can appeal based on two grounds:\n\n \n\n1. if there is a legal question that needs to be addressed; OR\n2. if the evidence was enough to establish a strong possibility that the defendant committed the crime.\n\n \n\nIf the Court of Appeal agrees with the appeal, they can cancel the acquittal and order a trial to take place in the Court of First Instance.\n\n \n\n(5) Appeal against order quashing indictment under section 81F of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance\n\n \n\nUnder [section 81F](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221/s81f) of the [Criminal Procedure Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/221), which applies to appeals from the District Court or the Court of First Instance to the Court of Appeal, the Prosecution can only make an appeal on a question of law. The Court of Appeal may set aside the quashing of the indictment and order a trial.",

        "question": "WHAT STEPS CAN AGGRIEVED INVESTORS TAKE TO RECOVER THEIR MONEY?",
        "answer": "**Prosecution**\n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has already referred the “minibonds” mis-selling cases to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which is a Hong Kong Government regulatory body that can initiate disciplinary proceedings. The SFC will carry out an investigation and will prosecute the violators if it finds sufficient evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n \n\nThe penalties available to the SFC include public reprimands, fines and suspension or removal from the list of licensed or registered persons.\n\n \n\n[Section 107 of the SECURITIES AND FUTURES ORDINANCE](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/571/s107.html), Chapter 571, Laws of Hong Kong provides:-\n\n \n\n- “(1) A person commits an offence if he makes any fraudulent misrepresentation or reckless misrepresentation for the purpose of inducing another person -\n\n  (a) to enter into or offer to enter into -\n\n  (i) an agreement to acquire, dispose of, subscribe for or underwrite securities; or\n\n  (ii) a regulated investment agreement; or\n\n  (b) to acquire an interest in or participate in, or offer to acquire an interest in or participate in, a collective investment scheme.\n\n   \n\n  (2) A person who commits an offence under subsection (1) is liable -\n\n  (a) on conviction on indictment to a fine of $1000000 and to imprisonment for 7 years; or\n\n  (b) on summary conviction to a fine at level 6 and to imprisonment for 6 months.\n\n   \n\n  (3) For the purposes of this section -\n\n  (a) \"fraudulent misrepresentation\" means -\n\n  (i) any statement which, at the time when it is made, is to the knowledge of its maker false, misleading or deceptive;\n\n  (ii) any promise which, at the time when it is made, its maker has no intention of fulfilling, or is to the knowledge of its maker not capable of being fulfilled;\n\n  (iii) any forecast which, at the time when it is made, is to the knowledge of its maker not justified on the facts then known to him; or\n\n  (iv) any statement or forecast from which, at the time when it is made, its maker intentionally omits a material fact, with the result that -\n\n  (A) in the case of the statement, the statement is rendered false, misleading or deceptive; or\n\n  (B) in the case of the forecast, the forecast is rendered misleading or deceptive;\n\n   \n\n  (b) \"reckless misrepresentation\" means -\n\n  (i) any statement which, at the time when it is made, is false, misleading or deceptive and is made recklessly;\n\n  (ii) any promise which, at the time when it is made, is not capable of being fulfilled and is made recklessly;\n\n  (iii) any forecast which, at the time when it is made, is not justified on the facts then known to its maker and is made recklessly; or\n\n  (iv) any statement or forecast from which, at the time when it is made, its maker recklessly omits a material fact, with the result that -\n\n  (A) in the case of the statement, the statement is rendered false, misleading or deceptive; or\n\n  (B) in the case of the forecast, the forecast is rendered misleading or deceptive.”\n\nRecently certain bank officers have been prosecuted under section 107.\n\n \n\nHowever, even after successful prosecution of bank officers or financial institutions by the SFC, aggrieved investors are not automatically entitled to compensation for their loss. Additional separate Civil proceedings are also needed. That is, the investors must still sue the relevant party (or parties) in Court to recover all or part of their losses.\n\n \n\n**Damages for the Loss**\n\n \n\nAs previously said, both the SFC and HKMA cannot order compensation be paid to the aggrieved investors. This generally requires a court order.\n\n \n\n[Section 108 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/hk/legis/en/ord/571/s108.html) lists out civil liability for inducing others to invest money in certain cases.\n\n \n\nCompensation, then, is a matter for the Civil Courts.\n\n \n\n**Civil Court Proceedings**\n\n \n\nFor claims of up to HK$75,000, aggrieved investors have to commence legal proceedings in the Small Claims Tribunal where no legal representation is allowed.\n\n \n\nFor claims over HK$75,000 up to HK$3,000,000, legal action must be commenced in the District Court. Claims above HK$3,000,000 must be presented in the Court of First Instance of the High Court of Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nIn both the District Court and the High Court, legal representation is allowed. Investors who have difficulty funding their litigation could approach the Legal Aid Department. Their financial position and the merits of their cases would be scrutinized before Legal Aid is granted.\n\n \n\nHowever, investors may choose to represent themselves in court and act “in person”.\n\n \n\n**Alternative Dispute Resolution**\n\n \n\nAs an alternative to bringing civil action in Court, the parties could attempt to resolve their disputes through other dispute resolution mechanisms. The most common means are mediation and arbitration.\n\n \n\nThe HKMA has made available mediation and arbitration services for helping resolve questions of compensation between investors and banks.\n\n \n\nThe service is provided by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC). The HKMA will pay the investor’s share of the fee for these services on behalf of (1) investors whose complaints in relation to the sale of the products have already been referred by the HKMA to the SFC for the SFC to decide whether or not to take any further action, or (2) investors whose complaint has already resulted in a finding against a relevant individual or executive officer by either the HKMA or the SFC.\n\n \n\nActivation of the mediation process requires agreement from both the investor and the bank in question. Mediation is a form of voluntary dispute resolution which involves appointing a neutral mediator, who will bring the two parties together with the aim of settling claims in a speedy, confidential and amicable way, or of narrowing the issues in dispute. The mediator has no powers to decide or pass judgment on the dispute, but has training and experience in helping parties reach a negotiated settlement.\n\n \n\nIf, after mediation, the case remains unresolved, the HKMA suggests that the two parties consider agreeing to appoint an arbitrator with powers to decide the case on the basis of documentary evidence submitted by both parties. As with mediation, the initiation of arbitration requires the agreement of both parties.\n\n \n\nFor cases that the HKMA has not referred to the SFC for investigation, or cases that have not resulted in a finding against a relevant individual or executive officer by either the HKMA or the SFC, banks and customers could still try to settle these cases through mediation and/or by arbitration.\n\n \n\nThere are a number of organizations in Hong Kong which provide lists of mediators and arbitrators for the general public. The major providers are: the[ Hong Kong Bar Association](http://www.hkba.org/), the[ Law Society of Hong Kong](http://www.hklawsoc.org.hk/pub_e/default.asp) and the [Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC)](http://www.hkiac.org/).",

        "question": "WHAT CAN AN AGGRIEVED INVESTOR DO? IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET BACK THE PRINCIPAL SUM THAT THEY INVESTED?",
        "answer": "An investor could pursue legal action in tort [a wrong that involves a breach of a duty of care owed to someone else] and/or under contract law, as the facts suit. He could sue for damages in tort, or claim for damages for breach of contract and/or could also ask the court to rescind the contract so that he can get back what he paid.\n\n \n\nThe bank or financial institution would be pursued as the principal of the particular bank officer or broker in question who sold the “minibonds”. It would be difficult to pursue legal action against the issuers since the investor would normally have no direct dealings with them.\n\n \n\nMoreover, the issuers of the products are most likely companies registered overseas with limited liability and limited financial resources. It would be fruitless to engage in legal action against the issuers directly.\n\n \n\n**Tort Law**\n\n \n\nA principal is liable for the negligence of his agent whilst acting in the course of his authority, as joint tortfeasors [persons who commit a tort] they are jointly and severally liable. If the principal gave the agent express or implied authority to commit an act which is wrongful under the law of tort, the principal will be liable, even though he may be the employer of an independent contractor.\n\n \n\nLiability of the principal may also be founded under the doctrine of ratification. If one person commits a tort whilst acting on behalf of another person, albeit without his authority, and that other person later ratifies the act, he becomes just as responsible for the wrong as if he had authorised it initially, before its commission.\n\n \n\nA bank, as the principal, would be vicariously liable for the actions of its employees who are acting in the course of their employment.\n\n \n\nIn order to determine whether or not a bank was negligent in selling the “minibonds”, the first thing to decide is whether or not a duty of care was owed to the investor.\n\n \n\nWhilst a banker must exercise due care and skill in the business of banking, it is not part of his ordinary business to give advice regarding investments. In the normal course of events a bank does not owe a duty of care, whether in tort or in contract, to give any explanation or to advise the taking of independent advice, to a customer who comes to its premises in order to sign securities. However, if giving investment advice forms part of the ordinary business of a bank, the bank has a duty not to act negligently or fraudulently in giving such advice.\n\n \n\nThe manager of a finance company owes a duty of care to prospective investors where he claims skill and competence in investment, especially when he himself will benefit from the brokerage of an investment. The standard of care is that of an ordinary prudent and skilful financial adviser.\n\n \n\nIn other words, if a bank officer or broker professes himself to have skill and competence in investing in “minibonds”, a duty of care [a duty of care arises when one person undertakes an activity which could harm another person physically, mentally or economically] will be owed to the prospective investor.\n\n \n\nIf the bank assumed liability for the accuracy of the advice given and the customer relied on that advice, the bank will be liable to the customer under the tort of negligent misstatement.\n\n \n\nIf the investor relied on the bank officer’s words that the products were “just like a time deposit” or “100% principal-protected” (which in fact they were not), the bank would be liable (as the employer of the officer).\n\n \n\n**Contract Law**\n\n \n\nWhen an agent makes a contract on behalf of his principal with a third party, the transaction gives rise to legal effects between principal and third party, between agent and third party, and between principal and agent.\n\n \n\nThe general rule is that a principal, whether disclosed or undisclosed, is liable to the third party. An agent is neither liable under nor entitled to enforce a contract he makes on behalf of his principal. So if a bank officer or broker makes a contract on behalf of the bank or the financial institution with an investor, the bank or the financial institution will be liable to the investor under the contract.\n\n \n\nThere are 3 legal aspects an investor has to examine before taking legal action against the bank or financial institution involved: **misrepresentation**, **undue influence** and **non est factum [not my deed]**. These three terms are explained below.\n\n \n\nMisrepresentation :\n\n \n\nA person is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation if he makes an ambiguous statement intending it to bear a meaning which is to his knowledge untrue, and if the statement is reasonably understood in that sense by the other party. In such a case it is no defence for the person making the representation to show that, on its true construction, the statement bore a meaning that was in fact true.\n\n \n\nA misrepresentation is negligent if it is made carelessly and in breach of a duty owed by the representor [the person making the representation] to the representee to take reasonable care that the representation is accurate.\n\n \n\nA misrepresentation generally has no effect unless it is material. That is, it must be one which would affect the judgment of a reasonable person in deciding whether or not, or on what terms, to enter into the contract; or one that would induce him to enter into the contract without making such inquiries as he would otherwise make.\n\n \n\nThere are two exceptions to the requirement of materiality. First, a person who has successfully perpetrated a fraud cannot be heard to say that the representation which he used to achieve this end was immaterial. Secondly, every representation is material if the contract so provides.\n\n \n\nThe person to whom the misrepresentation was made must have relied on it. He therefore cannot rescind, or claim damages, for misrepresentation if the representation did not come to his notice, if he knew the truth, if he took a deliberate risk as to the truth of the matter stated, if he would have entered into the transaction even though he had known the truth, or if he relied on his own information.\n\n \n\nTo give an example, if the customer would have purchased the products anyway no matter what the broker or bank officer told him, the broker or the bank officer could not be held liable as there was no reliance on them by the customer.\n\n \n\nUnder common law a person who suffers loss as a result of acting in reliance on a fraudulent statement can recover damages in court. He can generally do this whether he rescinds the contract or not, though he cannot pursue both remedies if this results in his recovering twice over for the same loss.\n\n \n\nThe general rule is that misrepresentation makes the contract voidable at the option of the representee.\n\n \n\nUndue influence :\n\n \n\nThe law of **equity** [legal principles which reflect fairness when the strict application of law would give rise to harsh results] gives relief on the ground of undue influence where an agreement has been obtained by certain kinds of improper pressure exercised by one contracting party on the other party.\n\n \n\nIn a number of situations the relationship between the parties involved in the contract is such as to give rise to a presumption of undue influence; and in these situations there is no need to show that undue influence existed and had been exercised.\n\n \n\nThe relationship between a banker and a customer will not normally give rise to a presumption of undue influence; but it can do so in exceptional cases if the customer has placed himself entirely in the hands of the bank and has not been given any opportunity to seek independent advice. For instance, if a customer and his banker have a long standing relationship and he placed himself entirely in the hands of his banker when purchasing “minibonds” without having the opportunity to seek independent advice, a presumption of undue influence could be inferred.\n\n \n\nNon est factum (“Not my deed”) :\n\n \n\nAs a general rule, a person is bound by his signature to a document whether he reads it or understands it, or not.\n\n \n\nSo an investor who singed a document or contract to buy “minibonds” is bound by it and the terms therein. The terms would inevitably include the “risk disclosure clause” (see above) and a clause limiting or excluding the bank’s liability when the investment falters. However, the law recognises that if a person who could not read executed a deed after it had been incorrectly read to him, he is not bound by it. He could plead non est factum (i.e. not my deed).\n\n \n\nNon est factum can only be pleaded where the mistake of the signer was a serious one. The difference between the document as it was and the document as it was believed to be must be radical or substantial or fundamental. The plea of non est factum is not normally open to a person who is merely ignorant of (as opposed to mistaken about) what he is signing.\n\n \n\nCarelessness of the signer excludes the doctrine of non est factum. The signer can not rely on the doctrine if he or she has been careless in signing the document without reading it. For the same reason, a person cannot rely on the doctrine if he signs a document containing blank spaces, and these blank spaces are filled in later by another party otherwise than in accordance with the signer’s instructions.\n\n \n\nIn order to succeed, an investor would have to show that he did not know what he was signing or that the document/contract was incorrectly explained to him.",

        "answer": "In a large-scale property redevelopment, the following entities are usually the only parties that acquire land for redevelopment:\n\n \n\n- the Urban Renewal Authority (URA), or\n- property developers.\n\nIf the URA or property developers want to redevelop an area, they first consider acquiring the land by private agreement with the existing owners.

They must also provide to the Director of Lands any accounts, documents or particulars the Director of Lands may reasonably require in support of such claims. It is common practice for the claimant to submit his claim to the Director of Lands in writing.",

        "answer": "In accordance with [section 45](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/511/s45.html) of the [Estate Agents Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/511/) ([Cap. 511](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/511/) of the Laws of Hong Kong), you and your agent must sign an agency agreement before you engage your agent to perform agency work to sell a **residential property**. Otherwise, the agent cannot serve you.\n\n \n\nThe Estate Agency Agreement for Sale of Residential Properties in Hong Kong (Form 3) is designed for **Vendors** . This agreement is provided by the Estate Agents Authority in accordance with the Estate Agents Ordinance. It must be duly signed by you and your estate agent.\n\n \n\nThe items contained in this agency agreement include: the duties of the agent, the commission payable by the vendor and the validity period of that agreement, etc.\n\n \n\nYou can use the services of more than one agent in respect of the same flat if you want to. However, you are reminded **NOT** to state that the agent is your **exclusive agent** in any agency agreement if you want 2 or more agents to help you. Otherwise, you will also have to pay the exclusive agent a commission even if you sell your flat through another agent (i.e. you would have to pay commission to both agents).\n\n \n\nYou can download \"Form 3\" from the [Estate Agents Authority's webpage](http://www.eaa.org.hk/practice/documents/form3.doc). You should read this agreement carefully before you sign it.  If you do not understand any part of it, ask the agent or your solicitor. You should ask your agent to give you a copy of the agreement you have signed. You should also keep the agreement in a safe place for future reference if needed.\n\n \n\nIn addition to the estate agency agreement, you and your agent must also sign a [Property Information Form](http://www.eaa.org.hk/practice/documents/form1.doc), or \"Form 1\" which contains details of your property (e.g. current ownership, floor area, encumbrances (e.g. any existing mortgage or repairing order issued by government authorities), any existing tenancy, year of completion, use restriction (e.g. residential, industrial or other use), any previous additions or alteration work done by the vendor, the lease term (lease period) of the relevant government lease/grant, repairs or improvement works and costs for such works required or proposed for the flat or the building where the flat forms part etc.). You should, to the best of your knowledge, give correct information to your agent. Your agent should also endeavour to check the accuracy of any information regarding your property. If false information has been provided to a purchaser which resulted in any loss to him, you and/or your agent will be liable to be sued by the purchaser for compensation.\n\n \n\nThe estate agency agreement aims to provide protection to residential property owners who are mostly persons without much legal knowledge of property transactions. If you want to sell a **non-residential property** (such as commercial or industrial property) through an agent without signing an estate agency agreement, you still have protection from the statute laws of Hong Kong (e.g. the Estate Agents Ordinance), the regulations imposed by the Estate Agents Authority (e.g. the Code of Ethics), and [Common Law](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/saleAndPurchaseOfProperty/the_estate_agents_services/q11). Nevertheless, your agent may ask you to sign an estate agency agreement. Since the Estate Agents Authority does not provide any recommended agreement form for non-residential property, you should read the agreement carefully before you sign it.

You should mark clearly in your estate agency agreement that the respective agent is a \"dual agency\" (the agent acts for both the vendor and the purchaser), or \"potentially dual agency\" (the agent acts for the vendor only but may also act for the purchaser at a later stage).",

        "question": "I WANT TO BUY A FLAT. WHAT SERVICES CAN I EXPECT AND WHAT INFORMATION CAN I OBTAIN FROM THE AGENT WHO SHOWS ME A FLAT?",
        "answer": "The agent should:\n\n \n\n1. Provide you with the necessary information about the flat (see below);\n2. Arrange for you to inspect the flat;\n3. Arrange for negotiations with the vendor;\n4. Pass on all your offers to the vendor (see below);\n5. Help you negotiate and sign the provisional agreement with the vendor.\n\nWith regard to point (a) above, the necessary information includes: current ownership, floor area, encumbrances (e.g. any existing mortgage or repairing order), any existing tenancy, year of completion, use restriction (e.g. residential, industrial or other use), any previous additions or alteration work done by the vendor, the lease term (lease period) of the relevant government lease/grant, repairs or improvement works and costs for such works required or proposed for the flat or the building where the flat forms part etc.\n\n \n\nFurther to point (d) above, in case your agent hears about or receives a higher offer from another potential purchaser, your agent must inform you about such offer immediately (since you may wish to make a higher revised offer). If your agent fails to do so, you may sue him/her for compensation.\n\n \n\nYou can also obtain the details of your target flat from the Property Information Form (also called \"Form 1\"). For the information contained in Form 1, please go back to question 2. The Property Information Form is to be completed by the vendor and the vendor's agent.\n\n \n\nNote 4 of Form 1 has stipulated, \"A licensed estate agent is required to provide to a purchaser the original or copy of the completed Form unless the purchaser specifically waives his right to receive the same\". For more information about this Form, please go back to [question 2](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/saleAndPurchaseOfProperty/the_estate_agents_services/q2).\n\n \n\nIt is very important that the agent is honest with you and the agent should always act in your best interest.",

        "question": "AS A PURCHASER, MUST I SIGN AN ESTATE AGENCY AGREEMENT WHEN I ASK AN AGENT TO SHOW ME A FLAT?",
        "answer": "With reference to [section 45](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/511/s45.html) of the [Estate Agents Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/511/), you and your agent must sign an agency agreement before you engage an agent to perform agency services to purchase (or inspect) a **residential property**. Otherwise, the agent cannot serve you.\n\n \n\nThe Estate Agency Agreement for Purchase of Residential Properties in Hong Kong (Form 4) is designed for **Purchasers** . This agreement is provided by the Estate Agents Authority in accordance with the Estate Agents Ordinance. It must be duly signed by you and your agent. The items contained in this agency agreement include: the duties of the agent, the commission payable by the purchaser and the validity period of that agreement, etc.\n\n \n\nYou can download \"Form 4\" at [Estate Agents Authority's webpage](http://www.eaa.org.hk/practice/documents/form4.doc). You should read this agreement carefully before you sign it. If you do not understand any part of it, ask the agent or your solicitor. You should ask your agent to give you a copy of the agreement you have signed. You should also keep the agreement in a safe place for future reference if needed.\n\n \n\nThe estate agency agreement aims to provide protection to purchasers of residential properties who are mostly persons without much legal knowledge about property transactions. If you wish to purchase a **non-residential property** (such as commercial or industrial property) through an agent without signing an estate agency agreement, you still have protection from the statute laws of Hong Kong (e.g. the Estate Agents Ordinance), the regulations imposed by the Estate Agents Authority (e.g. the Code of Ethics), and [Common Law](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/saleAndPurchaseOfProperty/the_estate_agents_services/q11). Nevertheless, your agent may ask you to sign an estate agency agreement. Since the Estate Agents Authority does not provide any recommended agreement form for non-residential property, you should read the agreement carefully before you sign it.

        "answer": "A client's interests are NOT ONLY protected by the estate agency agreement. In addition to the terms as set out in the agency agreement, your interests (no matter whether you are the vendor or the purchaser) are always protected by statute laws as well as the [Common Law](https://clic.org.hk/en/glossary). These laws tackle some kinds of misconduct that might be committed by estate agents e.g. misrepresentation and negligence.\n\n \n\n**Misrepresentation (Misleading Information)**\n\n \n\nA person who had made a false statement of fact which induced another person to enter into a contract would be guilty of making a misrepresentation. The three pre-requisites for misrepresentation are: i) someone has given a statement of fact, ii) that statement is wrong, and iii) that false statement induced (i.e. persuaded) the victim to enter into a contract.\n\n \n\nNote that a \"statement of fact\" is different from a \"statement of opinion\". For example, an agent would only have given a **statement of** **opinion** if he told you that the bedroom may accommodate a piano and a bed, and asked you to take some measurements of your own afterwards. However, he would have made a **statement of fact** if he told you that the size of the bedroom is 150 sq. feet. The agent would be liable for misrepresentation if you signed the provisional agreement after hearing his statement, but subsequently discovered that the actual size of the bedroom is only 100 sq. feet.\n\n \n\n**Negligence**\n\n \n\nIn order to incur liability for negligence, 3 conditions must be satisfied: i) one party owes a **\"duty of care\"** to the other party, ii) the former has breached the duty, and iii) the latter has suffered loss due to such breach of duty. The concept of duty of care comes from a well-known British case (Donoghue v Stevenson) which states that everyone should take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which are likely to injure his neighbour. The word \"neighbour\" does not simply include the person living next door to your home. It generally covers any persons who are likely to be affected by your activities.\n\n \n\nIn the context of property transactions, your agent would certainly owe you a duty of care because his conduct in handling your deal would affect your interests. Your agent would be negligent if, for example, he failed to carry out a proper inspection of the property and failed to inform you of the existence of a tenancy before you signed the provisional sale and purchase agreement.\n\n \n\n**Remedies**\n\n \n\nYou are entitled to sue your estate agent and his employer for compensation if it can be proved that your agent has committed misrepresentation or negligence. However, you may or may not be able to terminate the provisional sale and purchase agreement (or the formal agreement). This depends on the actual circumstances.\n\n \n\nThe following examples may help make the position clearer:\n\n \n\n**Example 1**: The estate agent acts for both the vendor and you, and the vendor gives the estate agent false information which he passes on to you.\n\n \n\nAnswer: You can terminate the provisional sale and purchase agreement and get a refund of the deposit. You can also sue the vendor for compensation.\n\n \n\n**Example 2**: The estate agent acts for both the vendor and you, and he passes on false information to you other than on the instruction of the vendor.\n\n \n\nAnswer: Even if the vendor does not know what the agent has said, that agent is also acting on behalf of him and you have relied on the agent's information in signing the agreement. Besides suing the estate agent for compensation, you may terminate the provisional sale and purchase agreement and get a refund of the deposit.\n\n \n\n**Example 3**: The estate agent only acts for you but not the vendor, and makes a false statement to you about the property.\n\n \n\nAnswer: Unless you are prepared to give up the deposit, you cannot unilaterally terminate the provisional sale and purchase agreement since the vendor is not responsible for what the estate agent said. You should sue your estate agent directly for compensation.",

        "answer": "Ask your agent or the vendor whether there is anything that may affect or lower the value of the flat, or better still, try to obtain a copy of the land search record about the flat.\n\n \n\n**What is a land search?**\n\n \n\nA land search is a search of a property maintained by the Land Registry of the HKSAR Government, which records the transactions relating to the history of the flat and other relevant information. For example, it will show you things like:\n\n \n\n1. the present owner of the flat and all the previous owners of the flat;\n2. details of the flat (e.g. the address and government lease term of the relevant land lot);\n3. whether there is any government order in respect of the flat that has not yet been complied with (e.g. a repairing order, or an order to demolish an unauthorized structure);\n4. whether there is any mortgage not yet discharged;\n5. whether there is any lawsuit concerning the flat (e.g. a bank suing the owner for some outstanding mortgage repayments).\n\n**Note:\n\\**The land search record only shows you general information plus an outline of any encumbrances (see below) about a property. It would be helpful if you can obtain the record before you sign the provisional agreement. However, you cannot rely on such record to complete the whole transaction without the assistance of a solicitor.\\****\n\n \n\n**Encumbrance** is a charge or liability which the flat is subject to or anything that can (i) reduce the value of a flat or (ii) obstruct the owner from selling a flat. Examples of encumbrances are: mortgages, a covenant (a formal agreement or promise) restricting the use of the flat, or charging orders imposed by the government or by an individual. Your solicitor must inform you (in any event not later than completion date for the sale and purchase) about any encumbrances found in the land search record or the title deeds.\n\n \n\nFor more information about land searches, please visit the [Land Registry's webpage](http://www.landreg.gov.hk/en/services/services_b.htm).",

Please note that **a tenancy agreement may not appear on the land search record** since a tenancy lasting not more than three years is not required to be registered at the Land Registry. Before the purchaser signs the provisional agreement for sale and purchase, the purchaser should ask about, and the vendor must disclose, any existing tenancy.\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, the vendor should carefully deal with any rental deposit in order to avoid future liability for it. The vendor can either refund the deposit to the tenant or transfer it to the purchaser (the new landlord) and make a proper written record of it.\n\n \n\nFor more details on this issue, please go to another topic - [Landlord and Tenant](https://clic.org.hk/en/topics/landlord_tenant/landlordSellsThePropertyWithExistingTenancy/).",

        "question": "IF A PURCHASER INTENDS TO BUY A FLAT OVER WHICH THERE IS A NEGATIVE EQUITY (THE PURCHASE PRICE TO BE PAID CANNOT FULLY OFFSET THE OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE LOAN), HOW CAN THE PURCHASER DEAL WITH THE RISK?",
        "answer": "Due to the downturn of the property market after 1997, the purchaser must ask the estate agent and the vendor whether or not the flat is subject to a negative equity.\n\n \n\nIf the answer to the above is \"yes\", the purchaser should negotiate with the vendor for the inclusion of a term in the provisional sale and purchase agreement that the deposits should be kept by the vendor's solicitor as stakeholder until and unless the vendor can show that the outstanding mortgage loan is not greater than the balance of the purchase price (full purchase price minus the deposits). This term can minimize the purchaser's loss in case the vendor fails to discharge the existing mortgage before the completion of the sale of the flat.\n\n \n\nThis term should be clearly stated on the provisional agreement otherwise it might not be inserted into the subsequent formal agreement. There was a High Court case in 1992 ([Chu Wing Ning v Ngan Hing Cheung](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1992/41.html)) in which it was explained that during the negotiation of terms for the formal agreement, a party is not obliged to accept a new term which goes \"entirely beyond\" what had been agreed in the previous provisional agreement.\n\n \n\nThe situation will be different if the vendor refuses to insert such a term into the provisional agreement and/or the purchaser is willing to accept the risk. It is recommended that a purchaser facing a negative equity situation should seek legal advice on this matter.",

        "answer": "It is best to inquire at a bank(s) about the possibility of a mortgage on the flat in question before you sign the provisional sale and purchase agreement.  Failing that, the purchaser should apply to a bank for a mortgage immediately after signing the provisional agreement. \n\n\nIn August 2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued a new circular to banks requesting them to apply a maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.  For residential properties which are for self-use with a value at or above HK$10 million, the maximum LTV ratio is 50%. For residential properties with a value less than HK$10 million, the maximum LTV ratio is 60%, subject to a maximum loan amount of HK$5 million. \n\n\nIf the main income of the mortgage loan applicant is not derived from Hong Kong, the maximum LTV ratio will be lowered by 10% points and for residential properties which are for self-use with a value below HK$10 million, the maximum loan amount will also be lowered to HK$4 million. \n\n\nIf the mortgage loan applicant or guarantor has borrowed or guaranteed other outstanding mortgage at the time of making the mortgage application, the maximum LTV ratio will be lowered by 10% points with also reduction to the maximum loan amount.\n\n\nPlease see the applicable details on the [HKMA circular](https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/guidelines-and-circular/2020/20200819e1.pdf).\n\n\nThe Mortgage Insurance Program (MIP) provided by HKMC Insurance Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited can provide mortgage insurance to banks, which subject to meeting the relevant eligibility criteria (the maximum property value and the maximum loan amount, etc.), can in effect permit banks to provide a mortgage loan of up to 80% LTV ratio under the MIP.\n\n\nPlease refer to the webpage of [Mortgage Insurance Program](https://www.hkmc.com.hk/eng/our_business/mortgage_insurance_programme.html) under the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited for the maximum LTV ratio and eligibility criteria details. \n \n\nAlso, the MIP is not available to applicants whose principal income is not derived from Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nWhat if the purchaser wants to acquire an additional and/or second mortgage?\n\n \n\nThe purchaser needs to check whether the terms of the first mortgage allows an additional and/or second mortgage before applying to a bank for an additional or second mortgage.",

        "answer": "**Step 1** . The vendor and the purchaser each appoint an independent solicitor to represent them.\n\n \n\n**Step 2** . **The vendor's solicitor prepares the draft formal agreement** . The vendor can include any special conditions he/she wants as long as the conditions do not violate any relevant ordinances or contradict the terms of the provisional sale and purchase agreement. On the other hand, the purchaser can also propose special conditions. Both parties must fully agree to all these conditions before signing.\n\n \n\n**Step 3** .The purchaser's solicitor then explains the terms and conditions of the formal agreement to the purchaser, who signs the agreement and its counterpart. Upon signing the formal agreement, the purchaser should also pay the further deposit either by a bank cashier's order (bank draft) or a cheque issued by a law firm. Usually the further deposit together with the initial deposit would be 10% of the purchase price.\n\n \n\n**Step 4** .The purchaser's solicitor will arrange to deliver the formal agreement signed by the purchaser(in duplicate) together with the further deposit cheque to the vendor's solicitor.\n\n \n\n**Step 5** .The vendor's solicitor explains the terms and conditions contained in the formal agreement to the vendor, who signs the agreement and its counterpart accordingly. Then, one agreement, signed by both the vendor and purchaser will be sent to the purchaser's solicitor and the vendor’s solicitor will retain one agreement signed by both the vendor and the purchaser.\n\n \n\n**Step 6** . The purchaser’s solicitor will register the formal sale and purchase agreement with the Land Registry.\n\n \n\n**Step 7** . The purchaser should consider buying insurance against any accidents (e.g. fire) which may result in loss or deterioration in the value of the flat after signing the provisional agreement or the formal agreement. **The purchaser takes up the risk of the flat (e.g. any accident causing damage) once the provisional agreement or the formal agreement is signed**.\n\n \n\n**Step 8** . The vendor gives the title deeds (documents showing who owns the flat) to his/her solicitor, who will pass them onto the purchaser's solicitor for inspection. If the title deeds are kept by the mortgagee (usually a bank), the vendor's solicitor will arrange for the release of title deeds from the bank to the purchaser's solicitor.\n\n \n\n**Step 9** . The purchaser's solicitor examines the title deeds, and asks the vendor's solicitor questions (legally called \"requisitions\") if he finds anything questionable. The vendor's solicitor must reply if the questions are reasonable. The purchaser's solicitor will let the client know if he/she is not satisfied with the answer(s) and if good title to the flat has been proved by the vendor.\n\n \n\n**Step 10** . The vendor prepares to deliver vacant possession (deliver a vacant flat) to the purchaser on the completion date, unless this is not required in the formal agreement, for example, the flat is sold subject to a tenant who is occupying the flat.",

This document, will not be subject to ad valorem stamp duty if the “new purchaser” is not a beneficial owner of any residential property in Hong Kong. (See [section 29AB](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/117/s29AB.html) of the [Stamp Duty Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/117/) ([Cap. 117](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/117/))). The Nomination must be presented to the vendor's solicitor for preparing the formal agreement.",

        "answer": "It all depends on whether the contract/agreement term being breached infringed is a \"condition\" (major term) or a \"warranty\" (minor term). For the breach of a condition, the innocent injured party is entitled to terminate the agreement and claim compensation. For breach of warranty, the innocent injured party is ONLY entitled to claim compensation. Whether a contractual term is a condition or a warranty should be considered using common sense and will depend on how serious the breach infringement is. If such a dispute is brought before the Court, then the judge will make the final decision.\n\n \n\nThis principle also applies to property transactions. If the vendor only broke a kitchen window (which can be considered as a breach of warranty/minor term), the purchaser can only claim the repairing cost, or ask the vendor to replace the window before the handover date. There is little likelihood of the purchaser being entitled to terminate the sale and purchase agreement and ask for a refund of deposits.\n\n \n\nAttention should also be drawn to any term like \"time is of the essence of this agreement\" or \"time must be strictly adhered to in this agreement\". This reminds the vendor and the purchaser that any late delivery of cheques or keys would constitute a breach of a condition/major term and entitle the innocent  party to terminate the sale and purchase agreement.",

        "answer": "With reference to the judgment of a Court of Appeal case ([Luk Stanley Ho Chang v Fook Man Finance Company Limited](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/cases/hkca/2006/478.html)), whether contributions to the cost of such repair or renovation works are to be paid by the vendor or by the purchaser depends on the construction of the particular clause in the relevant sale and purchase agreement.\n\n \n\nIn the subject case, a sale and purchase agreement dated 26 July 2005 was made between the plaintiff as purchaser and the defendant as vendor. The date of completion was to be on or before 25 August 2005. After the Agreement was entered into but prior to the completion day, the plaintiff discovered that the Incorporated Owners of the building had held a meeting on 4 July 2005 and had passed resolutions to carry out major repairs to the building and also to replace the lift.\n\n \n\nOne of the clauses in the Agreement provides that if any such notice or resolutions (requiring the vendor as one of the co-owners of the building to effect repair or renovation to any common part or facilities of the said building) existed prior to the date of the Agreement, the vendor’s share of the costs of such repair or renovation shall be borne and paid by the vendor. Since the resolutions were passed by the Incorporated Owners on 4 July 2005, which existed prior to the date of the Agreement, the Court of Appeal found in favour of the plaintiff (purchaser) and held that the repair costs must be paid by the defendant (vendor).",

        "question": "HOW TO SET UP AN OWNERS' CORPORATION?",
        "answer": "It is not necessary to set up an Owners' Corporation in every multi-storey building. However, the presence of an Owners' Corporation can help monitor and co-ordinate the various parties concerned with building management matters.\n\n \n\nThe following gives you a general idea of how to set up an Owners' Corporation:\n\n \n\n**Stage 1 (4 options)**\n\n \n\n1. A meeting of owners may be called for the purpose of appointing a management committee. A management committee will be appointed in accordance with the DMC, or by the resolution of owners with not less than 30% of **owners' shares\\* (see the \"note\" below)** in aggregate in the building**.** Owners may vote personally or by proxy to make resolutions ([section 3](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/344/s3.html) of the [Building Management Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/344/));\n2. If option (a) cannot be achieved, a group of owners who has not less than 20% of the owners' shares in the building can apply to the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs to order that a meeting of owners shall be called. At the meeting, a management committee may be appointed by a resolution passed by a majority of the votes of the owners voting either personally or by proxy ( [section 3A](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/344/s3a.html) of the [Building Management Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/344/));\n3. If option (b) cannot be achieved, a group of owners who has owners' shares of not less than 10% in the building, or the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, can apply to the Lands Tribunal to order that a meeting of owners shall be called. At the meeting, a management committee may be appointed by a resolution passed by a majority of the votes of the owners voting either personally or by proxy ( [section 4](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/344/s4.html) of the [Building Management Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/344/));\n4. If option (c) cannot be achieved and there is risk of danger to the owners or occupiers due to the absence of management committee and no management of the building, the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs can apply to the Lands Tribunal to order that a meeting (with a quorum of not less than 10% of the owners) shall be called. At the meeting, a management committee may be appointed by a resolution passed by a majority of the votes of the owners voting either personally or by proxy ( [section 40C](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/344/s40c.html) of the [Building Management Ordinance](http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/344/)).\n\n \n\n**Stage 2**\n\n \n\nThe management committee applies to the Land Registry within 28 days of its appointment for registration of an Owners' Corporation.\n\n \n\n**Stage 3**\n\n \n\nOwners' Corporation is formed when the Land Registrar issues a certificate of registration of the Owners’ Corporation.\n\n \n\n**Note:**\n***** The calculation of **\"owners' shares\"** (or **\"undivided shares\"**) is usually set out in the DMC. Normally, the shares may be calculated according to the floor area of each flat, in which some flats (with larger area) may have more shares than the others. Sometimes shares are also allocated to the common area of the building. For example: If there are 50 flats of similar area inside a building, then each flat owner holds a 1/50 share of the building (i.e. each flat represents 2%).\n\n \n\nIf you want to set up an Owners' Corporation, you are recommended to seek assistance from a professional management company. You can also obtain more information from the [Land Registry's webpage](http://www.landreg.gov.hk/en/services/services_c.htm).",

        "answer": "A deed of gift may create a potential defect in title. Under [section 49](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s49.html) of the [Bankruptcy Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/) ([Cap. 6](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/)), the Court make an order to set aside a transaction made by a bankrupt within a period of 5 years before he was adjudicated bankrupt if the transaction is regarded as an undervalue transaction. A deed of gift is regarded as an undervalue transaction under [section 49(3)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s49.html) of the [Bankruptcy Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/) ([Cap. 6](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/)). Hence if a person transfers his/her property to his/her spouse by way of a deed of gift and then the transferee wants to sell the property to a purchaser within the 5 years period of the deed of gift, the purchaser can challenge that the title is defective as the deed of gift may be set aside by the Court under [section 49(2)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/s49.html) of the [Bankruptcy Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/) ([Cap. 6](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/6/)).",

        "question": "CAN A PURCHASER REFUSE TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE OF A STIGMATIZED PROPERTY AFTER SIGNING THE PROVISIONAL OR FORMAL SALE AND PURCHASE AGREEMENT?",
        "answer": "Unfortunately, a stigmatized property is not a defect in title of the property. There is no legal definition of what constitute a stigmatized property e.g. does it mean a flat where a homicide or suicide has happened? Does it include a flat where a person die out of natural cause such as heart attack? Therefore it would be difficult to make enquiry with vendor and agent on whether a flat is “stigmatized “or not.\n\n\nHowever, some banks may have a “black list” of properties where unfortunate events had happened in the flat and had been widely covered by media eg homicide cases. There is no legal defect in title in the property but banks may be unwilling to advance mortgage loan to these black listed stigmatized flat for fear that in the event the banks need to exercise their power of sale due to default in mortgage repayment, the stigmatized flat may be difficult to sell as buyers may be deterred from buying the property due to the previous unfortunate event associated with the property. As the title of a stigmatized property is not defective, a purchaser cannot refuse to complete the purchase of the flat because previously an unfortunate event has happened or associated with the flat. However the purchaser would have difficulty in getting bank finance if a flat is listed by the banks as stigmatized flat.\n\n\nThe only practical solution for a purchaser is to seek pre-approval of mortgage loan before signing the sale and purchase agreement.",

You are entitled to a married person’s allowance;\n  - Child allowance for your newborn baby; or\n  - Dependent parent allowance for your parent who has attained the qualifying age in the year of assessment for which Provisional Tax was charged.\n     \n- Your net chargeable income for the year of assessment for which Provisional Tax was charged is, or is likely to be, less than 90% of the net chargeable income for the preceding year or of the estimated sum in respect of which you are liable to pay Provisional Tax.\n\n \n\n- You have been assessed to pay Provisional Salaries Tax and have paid or are anticipated to pay self-education expenses, contributions to a recognized retirement scheme, residential care expenses, home loan interest, qualifying premiums under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme Policy, qualifying annuity premiums, tax deductible MPF voluntary contributions or domestic rents during the year of assessment; and the amounts exceed or are anticipated to exceed the specified amount for the year preceding the year of assessment for which Provisional Tax was charged.\n   \n- You have ceased or will before the end of the year of assessment for which Provisional Tax was charged cease, to derive income chargeable to Salaries Tax. You should state the estimated amount of income for the whole year of assessment in your application and give reason for the reduction of income such as unemployment, retirement and salary reduction.\n   \n- You have objected to your Salaries Tax assessment for the year preceding the year of assessment for which Provisional Tax was charged.\n\n \n\nYour application must be made in writing and received not later than 28 days before the due date for payment of the Provisional Salaries Tax, or 14 days after the issue of the demand note concerned, whichever is the later.\n\n\nIf the Provisional Tax is payable by two instalments and the first instalment has been settled by the due date, an application for holding over of the whole or part of the second instalment may be made subject to the prescribed time limit and grounds for application.",

        "question": "HOW CAN MARRIED PERSONS REPORT THEIR SALARY INCOME?",
        "answer": "Married persons can choose \"separate taxation\" or \"joint assessment\":\n\n \n\n**i) Separate taxation**\n\nA husband and a wife are treated as separate individuals. Each is required to: \n\n- complete Tax Return – Individuals,\n- declare his/her income,\n- claim expenses (and deductions), and\n- pay any tax due.\n\n \n\n**ii) Joint assessment (applicable only if advantageous)**\n\nIf the earnings of one spouse are less than his/her tax allowance, allowance may not be fully utilised when the husband and wife are assessed separately under separate taxation. If a couple chooses to have a “joint assessment”, income and allowances for both husband and wife will be added together, and the married person's allowance will be deducted from their joint total income. Obviously, this will result in some savings in tax for the married couple.\n\n \n\nHence, where it appears that a joint tax bill may be smaller than your two tax bills added together, both you and your spouse should choose the “joint assessment” option in each of your Tax Returns on a year-by-year basis. While both the husband and wife must still file Tax Returns, if making the choice will reduce the total amount of taxes payable by the couple, only one notice of assessment will be sent out on their combined income from salaries, typically to the spouse who earns the higher amount of money and will demand payment of the tax. \n\n \n\nWhere joint assessment is elected, the spouses of a married couple must nominate one of them to be the person liable for the tax payable on their aggregated net chargeable income.\n\n \n\nIf a joint assessment does not result in less tax, the Assessor will automatically issue separate tax bills to each of you instead.\n\n \n\nPlease note that there is a time limit for the selection/withdrawal of a joint assessment. After initially choosing to have a joint assessment, should you change your mind and withdraw your selection, you will not be allowed to request a joint assessment again in the same year of assessment.\n\n \n\nAn election or withdrawal of joint assessment must be made:\n\n- within that year of assessment or the following year of assessment; or\n- within 1 month after the assessment for the year of assessment becomes final and conclusive, whichever is the later; or\n- within such further time, if any, as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may allow as being reasonable in the circumstances. \n\n \n\nAny married couple may choose “joint assessment” under Hong Kong Salaries Tax regulations, irrespective of their residential status. The point to note for joint assessment is that both spouses should have income assessable to Hong Kong Salaries Tax for the specific year of assessment in question.\n\n \n\n## [C.

        "question": "MS. R DROVE THROUGH 2 RED LIGHTS AT THE SPEED OF 100 KM PER HOUR AND THEN COLLIDED WITH A STATIONARY VEHICLE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD. UPON BEING CHARGED WITH DANGEROUS DRIVING, MS. R ARGUED THAT TREES BLOCKED HER VIEW OF THE RED LIGHTS, AND THEN SHE LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND IT DASHED INTO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD TRIED HER BEST TO KEEP IT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD. ASSUMING THAT IS TRUE, WOULD MS. R BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH THE CHARGE?",
        "answer": "If Ms. R’s view of the red lights was indeed blocked by trees, she should slow down her vehicle in order to ascertain the prevailing light signal. Every sensible driver should consider that proceeding with an unclear view is potentially dangerous. Further, the fact that Ms. R had driven through 2 red lights at an excessively high speed also reinforced the impression that she was driving in a manner that showed no regard for the safety of other road users. The consequence of Ms. R’s act of driving, i.e. crashing into a stationary vehicle on the opposite side of the road, is another fact from which the Court would likely draw an adverse inference against her in this case. A “*competent and careful driver*” should be well aware that loss of control of a vehicle is a predictable consequence of driving at such excessive speed. Even though Ms. R might have tried her best to control the vehicle, that itself cannot avail her in defending herself against the charge of dangerous driving.",

        "question": "MR. D, WHILE DRIVING, WAS STOPPED BY THE POLICE FOR A RANDOM BREATH TEST. MR. D, WHO HAD JUST ATTENDED A RAVE PARTY, WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT THE ALCOHOL LEVEL IN HIS BODY DEFINITELY EXCEEDED THE STATUTORY PRESCRIBED LIMIT. IN THE HOPE OF GETTING AWAY WITH THE CHARGE OF DRINK DRIVING UNDER SECTION 39 OR 39A OF THE ROAD TRAFFIC ORDINANCE (CAP.374 OF THE LAWS OF HONG KONG), HE MADE UP AN EXCUSE: “THE BREATH TEST TOOLS MAY BE INFECTIOUS” AND REFUSED TO TAKE THE SCREENING BREATH TEST. WOULD HIS PLAN WORK?",
        "answer": "The answer here is yes and no at the same time. Mr. D’s plan may enable him to get away with a drink driving charge. However, he would at the same time contravene [section 39B](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s39b.html), which provides that it shall be an offence if any person “*without reasonable excuse, fails to provide a specimen of breath when required*”. The excuse of being afraid of infection would not work unless there is medical evidence to prove that Mr. D is suffering from some kind of obsessive phobia. As a matter of fact, the sentence for failing to provide a specimen of breath is equivalent to or even more serious than that for “*driving a motor vehicle under the influence of drink or drugs*” or “*driving with alcohol concentration above prescribed limit*”. It is therefore really pointless for a driver to refuse to take a screening breath test.\n\n \n\nNote that according to [section 39B(5)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s39b.html), the police officer must “*warn a person at the time of requiring a specimen for a screening breath test…that a failure to provide it may render him liable to prosecution*”. A failure to give the warning would therefore invalidate a charge under [section 39B](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s39b.html).\n\n \n\nIf one refuses to provide the specimen, that of course constitutes failure. But the word “*failure*” here does not simply means refusal. By [section 39B(10)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s39b.html), a person fails to provide the required breath specimen unless the specimen “*is sufficient to enable the test to be carried out; and is provided in a way to enable the objective of the test to be satisfactorily achieved*”.",

A UNSTEADY ON HER FEET, HER VOICE SLURRED, AND HER BREATH SMELT OF ALCOHOL. DUE TO MS. A’S CONDITION AS SUCH, THE POLICE OFFICER FOUND THAT NO SCREENING BREATH TEST COULD BE CONDUCTED AT THE SCENE. MS. A WAS LATER TRANSFERRED TO A HOSPITAL WHERE SHE WAS STILL IN AN APPARENTLY DRUNKEN STATE. A POLICE OFFICER THEN REQUIRED HER TO PROVIDE A SPECIMEN OF URINE FOR A LABORATORY TEST. MS. A, SEEING THAT NO FEMALE POLICE OFFICER WAS PRESENT, REFUSED TO PROVIDE THE URINE SPECIMEN. THE POLICE OFFICER AND THE DOCTOR AT THE HOSPITAL THEN SOUGHT MS. A’S CONSENT TO PROVIDE A BLOOD SPECIMEN; SHE AGAIN REFUSED BY SAYING: “I DON’T TRUST YOUR DOCTOR AND YOUR EQUIPMENT. HOW DO I KNOW IF YOUR NEEDLE IS CONTAMINATED WITH AIDS OR NOT? I WON’T GIVE BLOOD TO YOU.” EVENTUALLY NO BREATH, URINE, NOR BLOOD SPECIMEN WAS TAKEN. WAS MS. A ENTITLED TO MAKE THE ABOVE REFUSALS?",
        "answer": "Ms. A’s refusal to provide the urine specimen is probably justified under those circumstances. But given that she was being asked to provide her blood specimen in a hospital and in the presence of a medical practitioner, her refusal to provide a blood specimen probably would not stand up as a reasonable excuse. In such circumstances, Ms. A would likely be liable for failing to provide a specimen under [section 39C](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s39c.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap.374](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) of the Laws of Hong Kong).\n\n \n\nIf a police officer suspects that Ms. A was under the influence of drugs (instead of drink), the police officer can require her to conduct preliminary drug test and to provide specimen of blood or urine for analysis. As in the above hypothetical scenario relating to alcohol test, Ms. A’s refusal to provide blood specimen in a drug related case would probably render her liable for failing to provide a specimen under [section 39S](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s39c.html) of the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap.374 of the Laws of Hong Kong).",

        "answer": "Probably no one would have noticed in that few days that the Vehicle Licence of your car had expired. But from a strictly legal perspective, [Regulation 25](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374E/s25.html) of the [Road Traffic (Registration and Licensing of Vehicles) Regulations](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374E/) ([Cap.374E](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374E/) of the Laws of Hong Kong) prescribes that “*no motor vehicle shall be upon…any road unless a valid vehicle licence in respect of the vehicle is displayed*”. The word “*upon*” means that mere parking—not necessarily driving—of a vehicle without a valid licence on a road would give rise to the offence. Further, the word “*road*” is given a broad definition in the [Road Traffic Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap.374](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) of the Laws of Hong Kong) as to comprising almost any place—including a parking lot; and section 118 of the same Ordinance prescribes that virtually all regulations made under the Ordinance shall apply to private roads as they apply to roads.

CAN HE ARGUE THAT HE HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG ON ANY ROAD (IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER IT IS A PRIVATE ROAD) BECAUSE THERE IS NO ROAD?",
        "answer": "[Sections 117](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s117.html) and [118](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s118.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap.374](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) of the Laws of Hong Kong) expressly stipulate that all major traffic offences shall apply to private roads as they apply to roads.

Further, under [section 2](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s2.html) of the same Ordinance, both “*road*” and “*private road*” are given such wide definitions that they include almost all kinds of places where a vehicle can be used.

        "answer": "Cyclist A can obviously be prosecuted under [section 45](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s45.html) (for reckless cycling) or [section 46](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s46.html) (for careless cycling) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap.374](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) of the Laws of Hong Kong). Depending on the evidence available, the prosecution may also consider prosecuting cyclist A on the more serious offence of “*injuring a person by furious driving*” under [section 33](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/212/s33.html) of the [Offences Against the Person Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/212/) ([Cap.212](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/212/) of the Laws of Hong Kong): “*Any person who, having the charge of any carriage or vehicle, by wanton or furious driving or racing or other wilful misconduct, or by wilful neglect, does or causes to be done any bodily harm to any person shall be guilty of an offence triable either summarily or upon indictment, and shall be liable to imprisonment for 2 years*”. Since the victim in this occasion died eventually, the graver offence of manslaughter may also be available to the prosecution. Detailed analysis of the offence of manslaughter is not within the scope of this discussion.

UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, WHAT ARE MR. C’S LIABILITIES (IF ANY) UNDER SECTION 56 OF THE ROAD TRAFFIC ORDINANCE (CAP.374 OF THE LAWS OF HONG KONG)?",
        "answer": "Obviously Mr. C had stopped. But as discussed above, “*stop*” means to stop and to remain at the scene of the accident for a period long enough for anyone to obtain from the driver the necessary particulars. Therefore, even though the driver of the other vehicle did not ask Mr. C for particulars, Mr. C had to stay and wait for the police. In other words, Mr. C did not comply with the duty to “*stop*” under [section 56(1)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s56.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)([Cap.374](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) of the Laws of Hong Kong). When Mr. C was approached by the police, he fully co-operated and gave all particulars to the police. It is therefore likely that Mr. C would not be prosecuted under [section 56(2)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s56.html) of the same Ordinance, i.e. under the duty to give particulars. What about the duty to report an accident under [section 56(2A)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s56.html)? If Mr. C did not give particulars at the scene of the accident, he was supposed to report to the police as soon as reasonably practicable and in any case not later than 24 hours after the accident. But since the police located Mr. C and obtained particulars from him in just one hour, could Mr. C argue that there was no duty to report under such circumstances? It should be noted that the words “*in any case not later than 24 hours after the accident*” do not mean that a driver can wait till the last minute of that 24 hours to report; he must report as soon as reasonably practicable. In Mr. C’s case, obviously he did not report immediately. But since the police had obtained particulars from him within just one hour, it was arguable that there was no further need to comply with the duty to report under [section56(2A)](http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s56.html). In this situation, Mr. C should at least have made a phone call to the police within that one hour—although a report by telephone does not satisfy the legal duty to report in person—to explain why he could not report immediately and to show that in any case he intends to report.",

        "question": "CAN A LEARNER'S DRIVING LICENCE HOLDER DELIVER TAKEOUT WITH HIS/HER MOTORCYCLE?",
        "answer": "Obviously a person with learner’s driving licence should not use his/her motorcycle to deliver takeout or conduct any commercial activities. Simple logic will tell us that a learner’s driving licence only entitles the holder to practise the driving of a motor vehicle (or a motorcycle).\n\n \n\nHowever, from a strictly legal perspective,\n\n \n\n1. there is no statue which expressly disallows the holder of a learner’s driving licence to deliver takeout with his/her motorcycle;\n2. under regulation [12DA](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/s12DA.html) of the [Road Traffic (Driving Licences) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/) ([ 374B](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/)), which specifically deals with the Commissioner for Transport’s power to cancel learners’ driving licences, there is nothing which empower the Commissioner to cancel a learner’s driving licence under similar circumstances; and\n3. while regulation [20](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/s20.html) of the [Road Traffic (Driving Licences) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/) ([ 374B](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/)) gives general power to the Commissioner for Transport to cancel a driving licence if the holder does not fulfill the conditions and requirements for the issue of the licence, or contravenes any condition of the licence, it seems that there is not any requirement or condition which prescribes that a learning driver cannot use his/her motor vehicle/motorcycle for takeout delivery.\n\n \n\nNevertheless, the third party insurance policy for a motor vehicle/motorcycle for learners certainly will be void if the motor vehicle/motorcycle is used for commercial activities such as food delivery.\n\n \n\nThe Commissioner for Transport may therefore rely on section [25(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s25.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)) to cancel the learner’s driving licence: “*The Commissioner may cancel the licence of a motor vehicle if… (vi)* *no valid insurance in respect of third party risks as required by the* [*Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance*](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/) *(*[*Cap. 272*](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/)*) is in force in respect of the vehicle*”.",

        "answer": "Strictly speaking, driving licences issued by other countries are not valid driving licences in Hong Kong.\n\n \n\nHowever, a visitor from abroad, if holding a valid domestic driving licence, may drive in Hong Kong  during the period of 12 months following the date of his/her last entry into Hong Kong (regulation [37(1)(b)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/s37.html) of the [Road Traffic (Driving Licences) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/) ([Cap. 374B](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/)).\n\n \n\nBut obviously the above regulation [37(1)(b)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/s37.html) provides only a temporary solution for a visiting driver. If a person holding a foreign driving licence is looking for a more or less long term relief, regulation [11(3)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/s11.html) of the [Road Traffic (Driving Licences) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/) ([Cap. 374B](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/)) would be helpful. It states that a person holding such foreign driving licence may apply for a full Hong Kong driving licence if he/she holds a driving licence issued within the last 3 years by a competent authority in any countries listed in Fourth Schedule of the said Regulations.\n\n \n\nIf the person holding a foreign driving licence does not come from those countries, and if he/she makes an application for a driving test within 3 months after his/her arrival in Hong Kong, he/she may apply for a temporary driving licence. The temporary driving licence is valid for 12 months from the date of the applicant’s arrival in Hong Kong (regulation [13](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/s13.html) of the [Road Traffic (Driving Licences) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374B/)).",

        "question": "IF I LET MY CHILD SIT ON THE DRIVER’S SEAT TO PLAY WITH THE STEERING WHEEL WHILE THE CAR IS STOPPED, WILL I BE CHARGED?",
        "answer": "Section [42(3)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s42.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)) provides that “*no person shall suffer or permit a motor vehicle to be driven by a person who is not the holder of a driving licence of the class to which such vehicle belongs*”. The question here, therefore, is whether your car is being “*driven*” by your child.\n\n \n\nRegulation [42(1)(a)](https://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/s42.html) of the [Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/) ([Cap. 374G](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/)) also provides that a driver shall not “*when driving a motor vehicle on a road permit any person not being a driving instructor to grasp or interfere with the steering, gearing or braking mechanism of the vehicle*”.\n\n \n\nIn the hypothetical scenario, “…while the car is stopped” is somewhat ambivalent. Is it stopped in the middle of a traffic jam? Is it stopped by the roadside or in a parking lot? Is the key in the ignition? Is the engine still running? As discussed above, there is no statutory definition of the word “driving”. We can only say that if you let your child play with the steering wheel when the engine is still running or the key in the ignition, no matter in what manner the vehicle is stopped, you probably have committed the aforesaid offence under section [42(3)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s42.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)) and regulation [42(1)(a)](https://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/s42.html) of the [Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/) ([Cap. 374G](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/)).",

        "answer": "It should be noted that under section [2](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s2.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)), both “*road*” and “*private road*” are given such wide definitions that they include almost all kinds of places where a vehicle can be used. Sections [117](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s117.html) and [118](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s118.html) of the same Ordinance expressly stipulate that all major traffic ordinances and regulations shall apply to private roads as they apply to roads.\n\n \n\nIt therefore does not matter whether the unattended vehicle is on a road or in a public area or privately run carpark.\n\n \n\nAccording to regulation [9](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374C/s9.html) of the [Road Traffic (Parking) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374C/) ([Cap. 374C](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374C/)), any person who “c*auses or permits a vehicle to remain at rest on a road in such a position or in such condition or in such circumstances as to be likely to cause danger to other persons using the road*” commits an offence and is liable to a fine of $2,000.\n\n \n\nThe Police is also empowered under section [103](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s103.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)) to remove any vehicle which “*remains at rest on a road in such conditions or in such circumstances as to be likely to cause danger to other persons using the road or to interfere with the use of the road*” when the driver cannot be located, is unable to remove the vehicle or refuses to remove the vehicle. If the owner does not come forth to claim the vehicle within 3 days, the Police will issue a notice to the owner demanding him/her to take the vehicle and pay the removal and storage charges within the next 14 days; and if the owner does not claim the vehicle accordingly, the vehicle will become Government property and may be sold.\n\n \n\nEven if the vehicle may not cause danger to other persons or may not interfere with the use of the road, if there is reasonable cause to believe that a vehicle has been abandoned, the Police may pursuant to section [107](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s107.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)) give notice to the vehicle owner requiring the owner to remove the vehicle. If the owner does not remove the vehicle within 7 days, the Police may seize it; and if the owner does not claim the vehicle within 14 days after the seizure, the vehicle will become Government property and may be sold.",

However, practically, an enforcement officer may not bother to find out whether a parking meter is in working condition and may just issue a ticket to you if you do not pay for the parking space. In such circumstances, you may find it useful to adopt the [Police’s recommendation](https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/13_faqs/faq_tri.html#po07).",

        "answer": "Section [4(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/s4.html) of the [Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/) ([Cap. 272](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/)) specifies that in order to “*use, or to cause or permit any other person to use, a motor vehicle on a road*”, there must be a third party risks insurance policy in force in relation to the user of that vehicle. The keyword here is “*use*”.\n\n \n\nRegulation [25](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374E/s25.html) of the [Road Traffic (Registration and Licensing of Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374E/) ([Cap. 374E](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374E/)) specifies that “*no motor vehicle shall be upon or used on \\*any road unless a valid vehicle licence in respect of the vehicle is displayed**”. The keywords here are “*be upon or used*”.\n\n \n\nIt is evident that there is a difference between the requirements for insurance and that of licensing:  \n\n- For insurance, you cannot “*use*” a vehicle if you do not have the insurance.\n- For licensing, you cannot have your vehicle “*upon or used on any road*” if you do not have the licence.\n\n \n\nJudging from the wording of these 2 statues, you may argue that you can leave a vehicle uninsured if you do not intend to “*use*” or you will not let anyone “*use*” your car on a road.\n\n \n\nNevertheless, even if no one is going to “*use*” the vehicle, you must maintain a licence as long as the vehicle is “*upon*” any road. Given the broad definition of the word “*road*”, which comprises almost any place, you certainly need a licence for the vehicle. [Regulation 21(1)(a)(ii)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374E/s21.html) of the [Road Traffic (Registration and Licensing of Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374E/) ([Cap. 374E](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374E/)) provides that a licence shall not be issued unless there is a third party insurance policy is “*valid on the date when the licence is to become operative*”. In other words, you must have a valid insurance policy as long as you continue to own the vehicle.\n\n \n\nNote: since the law only requires that there must be a valid insurance policy “*on the date*” when the licence is to become operative, you could obtain a licence with an insurance policy which will expire in the near future. So it is possible that there will be a time gap that an unused vehicle can be placed “*upon*” a road without a valid insurance.",

        "question": "IN CHINESE, THE WORD “ROAD” IS FREQUENTLY CALLED “馬路”, LITERALLY “HORSE WAY”, WHICH WAS SO DEFINED WHEN HORSES OR CARRIAGES WERE THE MAJOR MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION. NOWADAYS, CAN WE STILL RIDE HORSES ON ROADS?",
        "answer": "The Chinese term “馬路” (transliterated “horse way”) has almost completely disappeared in Hong Kong statutes. There are only 2 references to the Chinese term. Both appear in the [Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/) ([Cap. 374G](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/)); both are called “road” in the English version; and both are used in the context of pedestrians crossing the “road”.\n\n \n\nBut Hong Kong citizens have all along been using the term “馬路” (transliterated “horse way”) to describe the road in their daily language. It is therefore interesting to ponder upon whether riding horses on a road is permitted.\n\n \n\nAs a matter of fact, there is no law which prohibits riding of horse on the road. There are actually a few statues which suggest that it is not an offence to ride a horse on the road:\n\n \n\n1. Section [28(3)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s28.html) of the [Summary Offences Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/) ([ 228](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/)) stipulates: “*Any person who is found drunk while in charge of any vehicle (other than a motor vehicle) or of any horse, in any public road or street shall be liable to a fine at level 1 or to imprisonment for 2 months.*” That seems to suggest that you can be in charge of any vehicle or horse on a road as long as you are not drunk.\n2. At certain areas where equestrian centres or riding schools are located, you may see a triangular traffic sign displaying a running horse.\n\n![Horse](https://clic.org.hk/sites/default/files/inline-images/Horse%20image.jpg)\n\n \n\nAccording to Schedule 1 of the [Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/) ([Cap. 374G](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/)), “*This sign indicates that motorists are approaching a length of road on which they are likely to encounter horses.*” That again seems to suggest that horse riding is allowed on the road.\n\n \n\nThe Road Users’ Code published by the Transport Department, though not representing the law, also contains passages which indicate that horse riding on the road is allowed. For example:\n\n \n\n1. “*Riding a horse on roads with traffic should be avoided. However, if you have to ride a horse on the road, make sure you can control it in traffic.*”\n2. “*When riding, keep to the left of the road. If you are leading a horse, on foot or while riding another, you should also keep to the left and keep the led animal on your left.*”\n3. “*If you are riding a horse, you should wear a hard hat and lightcoloured, reflective or fluorescent clothing.*”\n\n \n\nIn view of the above, it is believed that it is not an offence for someone to ride a horse on the road.",

We suggest that you should pass the video clip (i.e. the memory card containing the video clip) to the Police and let the professionals do their job.\n\n \n\nWe do not recommend passing the memory card to any party involved in the traffic incident. The obvious reason is: you do not know which party has committed an offence (if any) in the incident; the apparent victim could actually be the offender. Then you may have passed a valuable evidence to the offender and give him/her an opportunity to destroy the evidence.

Settlement on a civil basis cannot exclude criminal liability. Let’s review a rather extreme hypothetical situation: A driver rode dangerously and crashed into your supercar, causing total loss of your supercar and permanent disability to you; but you, for whatever reason, reached a settlement with the driver whereby you did not require damages from him and even paid him $1 million. This settlement is of course binding on you; but it cannot negate the fact that the driver has driven dangerously and cannot stop the Police from laying charges against him. In the settlement agreement, the parties have probably agreed not to report the accident to the Police. However, even if you have agreed not to report the accident to the Police, such agreement has no effect because it may amount to perverting the course of justice.",

        "question": "IS IT PERMISSIBLE FOR A MOTHER TO RIDE ON A PUBLIC LIGHT BUS WHILE HOLDING HER 8-MONTH-OLD BABY IN HER ARMS?",
        "answer": "Yes, she can.\n\n \n\nThere are no provisions under the [Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/) ([Cap. 374D](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/)) which prohibit a mother from bringing a 8-month-old baby onto the a public light bus and carry it with her arms ride.\n\n \n\nNot counting towards maximum number of passengers\n\n \n\nFor the purpose of establishing the number of persons that may be carried in a vehicle, a child under the age of 3 years shall not be counted: *see* [Regulation 53(1)(a)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/s53.html) of [Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/) ([Cap. 374G](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/)). Thus, an 8-month-old baby would not count towards the maximum number of passengers legally permitted.\n\n \n\nLegal obligation to wear seatbelts\n\n \n\nHowever, passenger, in relation to a vehicle, is defined under the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)), [Section 2](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s2.html) to mean ***any person\\*** carried in or on it other than any driver or conductor of it. Thus, a baby may fall within the definition of “any person” and may be treated as a passenger.\n\n \n\nA baby as passenger would still be required to be securely fastened to his seat by means of a seat belt, if any, provided for his seat. Insofar as statutory definition is concerned, there is no differentiation between a baby and a child and an adult for the purpose of the meaning of passenger. So theoretically, a baby, as a passenger riding on the public light bus, still have to wear a seat belt.\n\n \n\nPractically speaking, since the size of a baby is too small, the baby may not be capable of being fastened by a seat belt properly. As the law would not require one to do the impossible, the legislative intent may not be that the baby is under an obligation to wear a seat belt.\n\n \n\nParent’s or care-taker’s duty of care to the baby\n\n \n\nPractically speaking, it is also quite rare that the parent or care-taker of the baby would allow the baby to sit on a separate seat on his or her own. Thus, the problem of baby wearing seat belt may not arise.\n\n \n\nUnder the common law of negligence, a parent owed a duty of care to the baby and is expected to exercise reasonable care and skill to ensure the safety of the infant on a public light bus. To allow a baby to sit separately may constitute negligence if the seat belt is not adequate to prevent baby from throwing forward or to some other directions.\n\n \n\nThus, a mother holding her 8-month-old baby with arms can ride on the public light bus.",

If all other seats are occupied, the number of persons that may be carried in a vehicle may be in excess of the number specified in the registration document of that vehicle or permitted by an excess passengers permit: *see* [Regulation 53(3)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/s53.html) of the [Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/) ([Cap. 374G](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374G/)).\n\n \n\nThus, the driver of the minibus may be held liable for driving in excess of the number of persons that may be carried in a vehicle and thus may be illegal in the event that the public light bus is full.\n\n \n\nLegal obligation to wear seatbelt\n\n \n\nHowever, passenger, in relation to a vehicle, is defined under the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)), [Section 2](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s2.html) to mean ***any person\\*** carried in or on it other than any driver or conductor of it. Thus, a child would within the definition of “any person” and would be treated as a passenger.\n\n \n\nEven if the number of persons that may be carried in a vehicle may not exceed the prescribed number of that vehicle, the child would also be required to be securely fastened to his seat by means of a seat belt, if any, provided for his seat because the child would still be treated as a passenger.\n\n \n\nThus, practically the child needs to occupy a seat alone.\n\n \n\nFare\n\n \n\nIt is customary that any child below 3-year-old does not have to pay the fare. However, it is not a legal requirement and thus a public light bus company can still collect fares on any passenger below the age of 3 at its own discretion. There is no legal entitlement for the passenger of any age to be exempted from paying fare.",

        "question": "CAN A TAXI DRIVER REFUSE TO TAKE A PASSENGER WHO IS KNOWN TO BE AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE CARRIER OR BE SUBJECT TO COMPULSORY QUARANTINE?",
        "answer": "The driver of a taxi shall not without reasonable excuse wilfully refuse or neglect to accept a hire from a hirer whether the intention of such hirer is indicated expressly or by implication: *see* [Regulation 37(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/s37.html) of the [Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/) ([Cap. 374D](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/)).\n\n \n\nIn determining whether the driver of a taxi has a reasonable excuse, the Court will look at the following three circumstances :-\n\n \n\n1. The matters said to constitute reasonable excuse must be identified;\n\n \n\n1. Whether the excuse is genuine, since the reason asserted for departing from a relevant prescription must be the real reason for doing so;\n\n \n\n1. Whether that excuse is reasonable, which the court will do on an objective standard depending on the particular facts of the case.\n\n \n\n[*See* ***HKSAR v Ho Loy\\*** (2016) 19 HKCFAR 110]\n\n \n\nWhat constitutes a reasonable excuse depends on the fact of each case and there is no hard-and-fast rule: *see****香港特別行政區\\*** ***訴\\*** ***梁偉民\\*** (HCMA 333/2018, 20 December 2018):-\n\n \n\n “*24.* *The Appellant’s appeal is allowed in the present case based on the special circumstances and evidence of the case. I must emphasize that the cardinal principle of “passenger having the right to choose taxi, but taxi driver cannot choose passenger” has not been changed. Taxi drivers in the industry should not treat the present case as the precedent of legal refusal of taking passenger. As to the meaning of “reasonable excuse”, it absolutely depends on the facts of each particular case and there is no hard-and-fast rule*.” [English Translation]\n\n \n\nIn***香港特別行政區\\*** ***訴\\*** ***王祁偉\\*** (HCMA 280/2015, 3 July 2015), the taxi driver in the mid-way stopped and requested the passenger to get off the car on the ground that he saw the passenger having red spots on his skin and mistaken that the red spots are infectious. The Court of First Instance held that the red spots may not be infectious and that the driver’s act was “discriminatory”. The driver in that case remained guilty of refusing or neglecting to drive the taxi to any place indicated by a hirer under [Regulation 37(b)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/s37.html) of the [Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/) ([Cap. 374D](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/)).\n\n \n\nHowever, each case must turn on its own fact. Where the driver knows that a passenger is suffering an infectious disease, a refusal to accept hire on the ground of “self-help” may constitute a “reasonable excuse”. Of course, this would also depend on whether such excuse is genuine.\n\n \n\nUnder [Regulation 32(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/599A/s32.html) of [Prevention and Control of Disease Regulation](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/599A/) ([Cap. 599A](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/599A/)), a person shall not, knowing that he is a contact or is infected with a specified infectious disease, expose other persons to the risk of infection—\n\n \n\n- by the person’s presence or conduct in—\n\n \n\n- any public conveyance; or\n\n \n\n- any street, public place, place of entertainment or assembly, club or hotel; or\n\n \n\n- by carrying on any trade, business or occupation.\n\n \n\nA person who contravenes [Regulation 32(1) or (2)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/599A/s32.html) commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine at $10,000 and to imprisonment for 6 months: *see* [Regulation 32(3)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/599A/s32.html) of [Prevention and Control of Disease Regulation](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/599A/) ([Cap. 599A](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/599A/)).\n\n \n\nThus, the ground of “self-help” may constitute a reasonable excuse in rejecting hire from hirer with infectious disease or under a quarantine order (where there is risk of infection of COVID 19).",

If they are breached, not all injured parties may be insured.\n\n \n\nIf it is stipulated in the insurance policy that it would only insure for the maximum number of the taxi, i.e. 4 persons, the fifth person may not be insured.\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, if it is stipulated under the insurance policy that the driver should not carry excessive number of passengers, it is inconceivable that any breach of that contractual warranties would enable the injured parties to obtain full compensation.\n\n \n\nIf it is stipulated under the insurance policy that the driver should not cause the taxi to be driven in an unsafe manner, driving an overloaded taxi may amount to driving in an unsafe manner and would affect the claim for compensation.\n\n \n\nThus, the injured parties may only be covered under the third party motor vehicle insurance to a limited extent.",

        "answer": "It depends on whether the passengers are giving coins not complying with [Section 2(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/s2.html) of the [Coinage Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/) ([Cap. 454](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/)).\n\n \n\nUnder [Section 2(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/s2.html) of the [Coinage Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/) ([Cap. 454](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/)) :-\n\n \n\n- The Chief Executive in Council may, by order, authorize the issue of coins with the design and of the denomination, composition, standard weight and remedy allowance specified in the order, and such coins shall, provided they have not been dealt with in any manner prohibited by law, be legal tender for payment as follows—\n\n \n\n- for coins of denominations of not less than $1, for the payment of an amount not exceeding $100;\n\n \n\n- for coins of denominations of less than $1, for the payment of an amount not exceeding $2.\n\n \n\n- Each coin shall be legal tender only for the amount of its denomination.\n\n \n\nAccordingly, the passenger cannot pay coins of denominations of less than $1, for the payment of an amount exceeding $2, or for coins of denominations of not less than $1, for the payment of an amount exceeding $100.\n\n \n\nHowever, even if the requirement of [Section 2(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/s2.html) of the [Coinage Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/) ([Cap. 454](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/)) has been complied with, [Section 2(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/s2.html) of the [Coinage Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/) ([Cap. 454](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/)) does not compel a taxi driver to accept small changes. This is because the medium of exchange is a matter of contract as between the parties. The driver of taxi is entitled to state under the contract that he doesn’t receive small changes. However, if the taxi drivers do not wish to accept small changes, the driver should have mentioned this to a passenger before the beginning of the journey or conclusion of the contract. If the taxi has told this requirement to the passenger, then the driver is not bound to accept small changes as [Section 2(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/s2.html) of the [Coinage Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/) ([Cap. 454](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/454/)) does not compel a taxi driver to receive small changes.",

        "answer": "What could the driver do if a passenger does not have money to pay for the fare?\n\n \n\nThe driver could request the passenger to give to the driver of the taxi his name and an address at which he can be found: *see* [Regulation 48(1)(c)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/s48.html) of the [Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/) ([Cap. 374D](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/)).\n\n \n\nIf the passenger refuses to give to the driver of the taxi his name and an address at which he can be found, the taxi driver may arrest the person and may detain such person until he can be handed over to a police officer: *see* [Section 58](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/s58.html) of the [Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/) ([Cap. 374D](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/)).\n\n \n\nCan the driver keep the HKID/passport/staff card/other personal belongings of the passenger until the fare is received, if the passenger is willing to do so?\n\n \n\n1. *HKID/passport*\n\n \n\nThe driver can only keep the HKID/passport of a passenger under a lawful authority or where a reasonable excuse exists.\n\n \n\nUnder [Section 7A(1A)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/177/s7A.html) of the [Registration of Persons Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/177/) ([Cap. 177](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/177/)), any person who without lawful authority or reasonable excuse uses or has in his custody or possession an identity card or other document issued under [Cap. 177](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/177/) which relates to another person commits an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine at HK$100,000 and to imprisonment for 10 years; and on summary conviction to a fine at HK$50,000 and to imprisonment for 2 years.\n\n \n\nUnder [Section 7A(2)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/177/s7A.html) of the [Registration of Persons Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/177/) ([Cap. 177](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/177/)), an accused person shall be deemed to have an identity card or other document or a forged identity card or other document in his custody or possession if he :-\n\n \n\n- Has it in his personal custody or possession; or\n\n \n\n- Knowingly has it in the actual custody or possession of any other person, or has it in any other place, whether occupied by himself or not,\n\n \n\nand it is immaterial whether the identity card or other document or the forged identity card or other document, as the case may be, is in such custody, possession or place for the use of the accused person or that of another person.\n\n \n\n**Lawful authority:**\n\n \n\n“Lawful authority” extends to and denotes any permission which may be lawfully given by a public officer or department or by a private person. It is submitted that this general definition applies: *see* [Section 2(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s2.html) of the [Summary Offences Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/) ([Cap. 228](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/)).\n\n \n\n**Reasonable excuse:**\n\n \n\nWhether the driver can keep the HKID/passport of the passenger depends on whether there exists any reasonable excuse for doing so. The relevant tests has been laid down in ***HKSAR v Ho Loy\\*** (2016) 19 HKCFAR 110, which are :-\n\n \n\n1. The matters said to constitute reasonable excuse must be identified;\n\n \n\n1. Whether the excuse is genuine, since the reason asserted for departing from a relevant prescription must be the real reason for doing so;\n\n \n\n1. Whether that excuse is reasonable, which the court will do on an objective standard depending on the particular facts of the case.\n\n \n\nFirst, the excuse which is said to be reasonable is to keep a passenger’s ID as a pledge to pay for the unpaid fares. The excuse may be genuine. Thus, the question is whether by applying an objective standard, the excuse is reasonable.\n\n \n\nIn ***HKSAR v Chung Ka Wai\\*** [2018] 2 HKLRD 1090, Hon Yeung VP held that :-\n\n \n\n“*34. This court should point out that in daily life, it happens quite often that people have in their possession/custody an identity card relating to another person, which may not necessarily involve inherently culpable conduct. For example, parents may have in their possession their children’s identity cards for safety reasons; spouses may, for some reasons, have in their possession the identity card of one another; the same is true for family members too. In some commercial transactions, staff members may also need to keep the customers’ identity cards for a short while. Under the above circumstances, if those parents, spouses, family and staff members must discharge their legal burden by establishing the defence of “lawful authority” or “reasonable excuse” before they can absolve themselves from liability, it will bring huge trouble to these people who are in possession of an identity card relating to another person. Yet, this court also needs to point out that, under the above circumstances, there shall not be any difficulty for those charged with possession of an identity card relating to another person to raise the defence of “reasonable excuse”*.”\n\n \n\nThus, whether there exists any reasonable excuse is a fact-sensitive matter. If the matter is said to be genuine, that the driver of the taxi genuinely wants to keep the passenger’s ID as a pledge, then it may constitute a reasonable excuse for keeping the passenger’s ID.\n\n \n\n1. *Other belongings*\n\n \n\nIf the passenger is willing to do so, it is not illegal for a driver to keep the staff card, or other personal belongings of the passenger until the fare is received.",

        "question": "IS THE CHARGING MODEL OF UBER TAXI LEGAL? DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IF THE TAXI LICENCE OWNERS HAVE AUTHORIZED THE DRIVERS TO JOIN THE UBER TAXI (AS HIRING)?",
        "answer": "Uber has stated clearly how the fares are calculated on their website as of June 2022: There are times when so many people are requesting rides that there aren’t enough cars on the road to help take them all. Bad weather, rush hour, and special events, for instance, may cause unusually large numbers of people to want to request a ride with Uber all at the same time.\n\n \n\n“*In these cases of very high demand, prices may increase to help ensure that those who need a ride can get one*.”\n\n \n\nIs the charging model of Uber Taxi legal?\n\n \n\nThe charging model of Uber Taxi is not illegal if it does not contravene any of the regulations under the [Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/) ([Cap. 374D](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/)) and the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)).\n\n \n\nGenerally speaking, where the vehicle is licensed as taxi, it is legal for the taxi driver to drive it for carriage of passengers for hire or reward, even if the taxi driver receives passenger through the Uber Taxi App: *see* [Section 52(3)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/s52.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)).\n\n \n\nHowever, the following should be noted :-\n\n \n\nFirst, no registered owner or driver of a taxi shall charge for the hiring of the taxi a fare exceeding the appropriate scale of fares specified in [Schedule 5](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/sch5.html) of the [Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/) ([Cap. 374D](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/)): *see* [Regulation 47(2)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/s47.html) of the [Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/) ([Cap. 374D](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/)). Thus, the charging model of Uber Taxi shall not cause the charge of the taxi fares exceeding the appropriate scale of fares specified in [Schedule 5](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/sch5.html) of the [Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/) ([Cap. 374D](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/)).\n\n \n\nSecond, the driver of a taxi shall not without reasonable excuse wilfully refuse or neglect to accept a hire from a hirer whether the intention of such hirer is indicated expressly or by implication: *see* [Regulation 37(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/s37.html) of the [Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/) ([Cap. 374D](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/)). Thus, a taxi driver who via the Uber Taxi App shall not refuse or neglect to accept a hire.\n\n \n\nDoes it make any difference if the taxi licence owners have authorized the drivers to join the Uber Taxi (as hiring)?\n\n \n\n[Section 52(3)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s52.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)) provides that no person shall drive or use a motor vehicle; or suffer or permit a motor vehicle to be driven or used, for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward unless the vehicle is licensed as a taxi.\n\n \n\nThus, so long as the vehicle is licensed as a taxi, a taxi licence owners can let the taxi to a taxi driver to join Uber Taxi under any hire agreement formed under [Regulation 38](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/s38.html) of the [Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/) ([Cap. 374D](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/reg/374D/)). It would not be illegal for the taxi driver to join the Uber Taxi in a criminal sense provided that there is no contravention of any sections or regulations under the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)).",

        "question": "WHAT COULD THE DRIVERS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT SERVICES DO WHEN THEY RECEIVE COMPLAINTS FROM PASSENGERS THAT THEY REGARD AS UNJUSTIFIED?",
        "answer": "The driver may ask the passenger to file a complaint at the Transport Complaint Unit, which would investigate into the case and decide whether it is substantiated. The Transport Complaint Unit deals with over 30,000 cases yearly and provides readily accessible electronic complaint forms to prospective complainants at https://www.tcu.gov.hk/eng/traffic-complaint.html.\n\n \n\n**What kind of resources can the drivers use if they have received complaint from the passengers?**\n\n \n\nIf a driver receives a complaint from passenger, the driver is of course entitled to use any evidence available to him to disprove any complaint or charge against him, this would include the video clips that recorded the dialogue between them and the passengers as evidence.\n\n \n\n**What kind of procedures would they need to face?**\n\n \n\nAccording to website of Transport Complaints Unit (see:  https://www.tcu.gov.hk/chi/index.html), all the complaints and suggestions received by Transport Complaint Unit will be referred to the relevant government departments and public transport operators for follow-up action.\n\n \n\nAccording to Transport Complaints Unit Report 2020 (https://www.tcu.gov.hk/annual/docs/tcu2020.pdf) at paragraph 3, investigations were to be conducted. After investigation, the result would be categorized as “substantiated”, “unsubstantiated”, or not pursuable due to lack of evidence. For “substantiated” cases, relevant government departments / public transport operators had either taken steps to rectify the situation or were considering possible solutions to the problems identified.\n\n \n\nIf the complainants agreed to be court witnesses, the cases would be referred to the Police for further investigation. Amongst the cases referred to the police, some drivers were summonsed.\n\n \n\n**Do they need to hire a lawyer?**\n\n \n\nOnce an investigation is laid against the drivers, whether by the Transport Complaint Unit or the Police, a potential criminal charge may be laid against the drivers. Thus, in order to protect the drivers’ interests or ensure the drivers be well-informed of their legal rights, they may have to hire lawyer throughout the investigation process.\n\n \n\n**Is there any means for them to reconcile with the passengers, or minimize the potential cost to be paid?**\n\n \n\nIt depends on whether the disputes between the drivers and passengers are giving rise to a civil claim or potential criminal offence.\n\n \n\nWhere the disputes between the drivers and the passengers only give arise to a contractual dispute, for example, whether the drivers have breached any terms of a contract, it is up to the parties to reconcile either by themselves or to resort any alternative disputes resolution instead of litigation.\n\n \n\nHowever, where the disputes between the passengers and the drivers are caused by a potentially criminal conduct on the part of the driver or giving rise to a potential criminal proceeding, to reconcile may amount to a concealment of the commission of an offence. This may amount to perverting the course of public justice. \n\n \n\nThus, in a criminal context, there may not be any other means for drivers and passengers for reconciliation.",

This is because the practical effect of allowing an advertisement to be published is to incite or invite any person to become an Uber driver, which is illegal.\n\n \n\nHowever, the prosecution may still have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the media intends to incite any person to become an Uber driver. Recklessness is not the requisite *mens rea* for incitement. The inciter must intend the other person to commit the substantive offence.\n\n \n\nIf it must be proved that the media by the act of broadcasting intended to incite any person to become an Uber driver, evidence to that effect must be adduced.\n\n \n\nIf the media has not read the advertisement before the publication, it could not be said that the media intends to incite any person to become an Uber driver.\n\n \n\nThus, it depends on the statement of the mind of the media at the time of the publication of the advertisement.",

        "answer": "Can a private car owner rent his car to someone else?\n\n \n\nUnder [Section 4(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/s4.html) of the [Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/) ([Cap. 272](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/)) :\n\n \n\n“*Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance it shall not be lawful for any person to use, or to cause or permit any other person to use, a motor vehicle on a road unless there is in force in relation to the user of the vehicle by that person or that other person, as the case may be, such a policy of insurance or such a security in respect of third party risks as complies with the requirements of this Ordinance*.”\n\n \n\nA private car owner may only rent his car to someone else if there is in force a policy of insurance in relation to the user of the vehicle by that person or that other person. Thus, unless there is in force an insurance policy in relation to the renter driver of the motor vehicle, any person may not rent a motor vehicle in the absence of such third party insurance policy protecting him or her against third party’s claim.\n\n \n\nFor the person who rented his car out, knowing that the renter of the car may not be covered under a third party insurance, he may be liable to “causing or permitting any other person to use a motor vehicle” without insurance.\n\n \n\nThe coverage of insurance policy is also a vital factor. Where the insurance policy only covers a private user instead of a commercial user, the rent of a car for commercial gain may not be covered under the original insurance policy.\n\n \n\nHowever, some motor policy often contains a provision extending the insurance cover to any person driving the insured car on the order or with the permission of the assured but such kind of cover usually only apply to third party risks. Where the original motor policy contains a provision covering the insurance of a permitted driver, both the person who rented out the car or the person who rented the car may not contravene [Section 4(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/s4.html) of the [Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/) ([Cap. 272](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/)).\n\n \n\n**What is the potential risk to the car owner and the car renter:**\n\n \n\nBoth the car owner and the car renter may be liable under [Section 4(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/s4.html) of the [Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/) ([Cap. 272](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/)) for “using”, or “causing or permitting any other person to use” a motor vehicle in the absence of a third party motor insurance in force.\n\n \n\nUnder [Section 4(2)(a)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/s4.html) of the [Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/) ([Cap. 272](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/)), if a person acts in contravention of this section, he shall be liable to a fine at HK$10,000 and to imprisonment for 12 months, and a person convicted of an offence under this section shall (unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise) be disqualified from holding or obtaining a licence to drive a motor vehicle for such period as the court may determine being not less than 12 months nor more than 3 years from the date of conviction.\n\n \n\nFor the car renter, in the absence of any third party insurance, any third parties may directly claim against that car renter instead of the insurer. Thus, there would be a risk of legal liability.\n\n \n\n**Does it make a difference if he just lends his car to a friend without charging him a fee?**\n\n \n\nNo. The fact that the car is lent without charge does not exonerate the car driver or the renter/friend from ensuring that there is in force a policy of insurance in relation to the user of the vehicle by that person or that other person. Thus, it doesn’t matter whether the car owner lent his car for fee or not, a third party insurance is required and any default in purchasing an insurance would be contravention of [Section 4(1)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/s4.html) of the [Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/) ([Cap. 272](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/272/)).",

        "question": "SOME RIDE-SHARING APPS CAN MATCH PASSENGERS AND DRIVERS WHO WISH TO TRAVEL ON THE SAME ROUTE AT THE SAME TIME. CAN A PRIVATE CAR OWNER RIDE SOMEONE ELSE WHO WILL REIMBURSE HIM A SMALL SUM FOR THE FUEL COST AND TOLL FEE? WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL RISK TO THE CAR OWNER (USUALLY THE DRIVER) AND THE PASSENGERS?",
        "answer": "Can a private car owner take on a passenger who will  reimburse him a small sum for the fuel cost and toll fee?\n\n \n\nUnder [Section 52(3)(b)(iii)](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/s52.html) of the [Road Traffic Ordinance](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/) ([Cap. 374](https://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/374/)), no person shall drive or use a motor vehicle for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward unless a hire car permit is in force in respect of the vehicle.\n\n \n\nHowever, in ***HKSAR v Yuong Ho Cheung & Ors\\*** [2020] HKCFA 29, it was held that :\n\n \n\n“*48. The hire or reward arrangement envisaged in s.52(3) is a **business one**. In this context, it is useful to refer to the House of Lords’ decision in **Albert v Motor Insurers’ Bureau**. Although the issue in that case concerned whether a particular arrangement was carriage that required the driver to have compulsory third party insurance, the ratio of the decision was that “‘a vehicle in which passengers are carried for hire or reward’ meant a vehicle used for the systematic carrying of passengers for reward, not necessarily on a contractual basis, going beyond the bounds of mere social kindness and amounting to a business activity”. The point is perhaps most helpfully expressed by Lord Pearson in his speech where he said:*\n\n \n\n*“One cannot fail to observe that a private motor car has passenger seats. The owner-driver of a private motor car can very easily be helpful and obliging to friends and acquaintances by giving them lifts in his car. He may himself like to have company on his journeys, but still he is conferring a favour. The passengers may, especially when this happens frequently, think it fitting that they should in return for the favour confer some benefit on the owner-driver. Many co-operative or reciprocal arrangements, which are natural uses of a private motor car, were suggested in the course of the argument. For instance, A and B may for their weekly game of golf travel to the golf course in A’s car driven by A, and B make his contribution by paying for A’s lunch or green fee or for the petrol that is bought on the journey. Mothers of children going to the same school may take turns at driving the children to and from the school. A party of men living in the same village and going to work in a city may take turns at driving the party in their respective cars. So long as such arrangements do not acquire the character of business arrangements they should be regarded as natural ways of using a private car as such and should not be regarded as involving the carriage of passengers for hire or reward*.”\n\n \n\nThus, whether ride-sharing apps matching passengers and drivers wishing to travel on the same route but the passengers only need to reimburse the drivers  for fuel cost and toll fee would be permissible depends on whether the whole arrangement amounts to business activity and there is a systematic carrying of passengers for reward (but not necessarily need to be on a contractual basis), going beyond the bounds of mere social kindness.\n\n \n\nTherefore, it is likely that ridesharing is not a business. The ride-sharer only shares the cost, e.g. fuel cost, toll fee, with other passengers. There is no profit gain on the part of the car driver, but only cost being shared. And obviously ridesharing is not systematic way to make a business profit.\n\n \n\nWhat is the potential risk to the car owner (usually the driver) and the passengers?\n\n \n\nSo long as the car owner has purchased a third party insurance and that the driver is not making a business profit, there is no risk for car owner to share the ride.\n\n \n\nThere is no risk for the passengers sharing the ride.",

        "question": "The calculation of traffic accident compensation",
        "answer": "Traffic Accidents: Generally speaking, compensation in traffic accidents includes the following items: (I) Pain and Suffering: Based on past court cases, the compensation amount is determined by comparing the pain and loss of enjoyment of life suffered by the individual due to the injury. For example, in the case HCPI 979/2007, the plaintiff suffered a fractured heel bone, affecting his work and life. After comparing similar past cases, the court awarded HK$500,000.00 for pain and suffering. (II) Loss of Income: If the injured party is unable to work due to taking sick leave, they are entitled to claim compensation for lost income. Furthermore, if the injured party cannot return to their job prior to the accident, they can claim the difference between their pre-accident income and their current income. In the aforementioned case HCPI 979/2007, the plaintiff was originally a container truck driver earning HK$15,500.00 per month. After the accident, he could no longer work in the same profession and could only work as a security guard, private car driver, or telephone operator. The court estimated that after the trial, he could only earn HK$6,000.00 per month, resulting in a monthly income loss of HK$9,500.00. Pre-trial income loss: HK$(15,500.00 – 6,000.00) x 17 months (unable to work in other jobs) + HK$15,500 x 26 months (unable to work) = HK$564,500.00 Post-trial income loss: HK$(15,500.00 – 6,000.00) x 12 x 9 (multiplier) = HK$1,026,000.00 (III) Loss of Mandatory Provident Fund: If the injured party is an employee, they can claim compensation for the loss of the mandatory provident fund, amounting to 5% of the income loss. (IV) Loss of Earning Capacity: If the injured party loses competitiveness in the general labor market due to the injury, resulting in job loss risk, the court will consider awarding compensation. (V) Other Losses: Hospital fees, medical expenses, transportation fees, supplement costs, etc. (VI) Interest.",

If the other party does not provide a constructive response within a month, the plaintiff can proceed to file a lawsuit without worrying about adverse cost consequences for not sending the solicitor's letter first. After filing, the court will schedule a Checklist Review Hearing for 5-6 months later.

        "answer": "If the party is a corporation, an officer of the corporation properly authorised by a letter signed by the director or company secretary and affixed with company chop may attend. If the party is a sole proprietor or a partnership, the sole proprietor or a partner properly authorised by a letter should attend. If the party is an individual and wishes his representative (other than counsel or solicitor) to attend the hearing, the party should apply for permission from the Tribunal specifying the reasons why he cannot conduct the hearing by himself. Unless the application is supported by good justified reasons and evidence, the Tribunal may not allow such application. Unless the party has the Tribunal’s permission, the party should attend the hearing in person. If the application is granted, the party has to issue a letter of authorization to his representative when attending court, provided that the representative must know the facts of the case.",

Notably, with the benefit of our experience, the time it takes to go through the SFC process has been getting shorter – even as short as less than two weeks.",

        "question": "What are the documents required for the application for registration of a private OFC?",
        "answer": "For the purposes of registering/incorporating an OFC, the following are required:\n\nCertain prescribed forms (e.g. SFC Application Form, SFC Information Checklist, Companies Registry Form, and IRD Form)\nInstrument of Incorporation\nOther miscellaneous items, such as a copy of the license certificate of the proposed investment manager, profile of each of the proposed directors, SFC license records of each of the proposed directors (if any), and cheques for application fees, incorporation fees, and business registration fees\nNotably, the OFC’s offering documents, the subscription agreement, the investment management agreement and any other agreements which the OFC typically enters into (e.g. fund administration agreement) do not need to be submitted to the SFC for the purposes of registering / incorporating the OFC – these can be prepared in parallel to the SFC application process. However, since the custodian of the OFC needs to sign the SFC Information Checklist, it is important that the custodian is appointed at an early stage to avoid delaying the process. The OFC’s fund administrator does not need to be appointed at the time the application to the SFC is made (in fact, there is no legal requirement to appoint a fund administrator).",

        "question": "For an OFC registered with the SFC (and a sub-fund that is established) but not launched, what are the audit requirements?",
        "answer": "If the OFC has not been launched and therefore has no investor (the “Conditions”), it is possible for the OFC to apply for an annual report exemption (“AR exemption”) from the SFC to exempt it from the requirements to prepare an annual report for a financial year, publish the annual report and provide a copy to any shareholder. An OFC is generally not considered to have been launched if it has not received any subscription proceeds for investments. For the avoidance of doubt, management shares, which are non-participating shares, may be issued by an OFC and the OFC is still not considered launched if no investor shares are issued to investors in consideration for subscription monies. Once the Conditions are no longer met, then the AR exemption will lapse and the OFC should notify the SFC in writing immediately.\n\nIf a particular sub-fund within an umbrella OFC has not yet been launched after it is established with the SFC, the financial position and results of that particular sub-fund does not need to be disclosed in the annual report because the directors of the OFC can choose whether the start date of a sub-fund’s first financial period should be its establishment date or its launch date – no waiver from the SFC needs to be sought for this purpose.\n\nSimilar to the above question, a sub-fund is generally not considered to have been launched if it has not received any subscription proceeds for investments and has no investor since its establishment date or the date of re-domiciliation (in the case of an existing sub-fund of a re-domiciled OFC).",

        "question": "Are there any tax disadvantages of using an OFC versus a Cayman fund?",
        "answer": "From the Hong Kong profits tax exemption perspective at the fund level, both privately offered onshore and offshore funds operating in Hong Kong may rely on profits tax exemptions pursuant to the Inland Revenue (Profits Tax Exemption for Funds) (Amendment) Ordinance 2019. Therefore, from this perspective, an OFC is treated in the same way as an offshore fund (such as a Cayman fund whose central management and control is outside of Hong Kong). In fact, in addition to enjoying the profits tax exemption on profits earned from transactions in assets of a class specified in Schedule 16C to the Inland Revenue Ordinance (i.e. “qualifying transactions”) and transactions incidental to the carrying out of qualifying transactions (i.e. “incidental transactions”), the OFC may also enjoy the profits tax exemption on profits earned from transactions in assets of a class that is not specified in Schedule 16C (i.e. “non-Schedule 16C class”) (subject to no percentage threshold) if the OFC does not carry on a direct trading or direct business undertaking in Hong Kong in assets of a non-Schedule 16C class or hold any asset in a non-Schedule 16C class that it utilizes to generate income. This provides a potential tax advantage for those who decide to use an OFC as opposed to, for example, a Cayman fund.",

        "answer": "It takes around one to two months for approval of the grant scheme application, and then a further approximately two weeks for the grant to be deposited directly into the bank account of the investment manager.\n\nPlease also note the following points:\n\nThe grant scheme application must be submitted to the SFC within three months from the date of the Certificate of Incorporation or certificate of re-domiciliation;\nGiven that the SFC expects that the grant scheme application to be made by the investment manager of the OFC, the investment manager should also be the entity to have paid for all the expenses that are intended to be claimed for the subsidy;\nIn the case of an umbrella OFC, the subsidy can be claimed for the costs of setting up more than one sub-fund within that umbrella OFC, provided that those sub-funds were established when the OFC was first registered – any subsequent establishment of sub-funds shall not be covered by the grant scheme; and\nThe grant scheme application for each OFC may only be submitted once. Hence, when the grant scheme application is submitted, all outstanding expenses which are intended to be claimed for the subsidy must be paid.",

This means, for example, if the fiscal year-end of an OFC is to be on 31 December, and if the OFC is incorporated on 1 July 2024, then the first fiscal year-end can be on 31 December 2025 at the latest.

There is no need to file annual tax returns to the Companies Registry, but the OFC must prepare an audited annual report and interim reports – please see the question above on audit requirements.\n\nPrior approval from the SFC is required for the following changes:\n\nAppointment of director, custodian or investment manager; and\nName of the OFC or its sub-fund.\nAdditionally, once the offering documents have been issued to investors, they should be filed with the SFC as soon as practicable, and in the case of changes, within seven days from the date of issuance of the revised offering documents. Filing involves only emailing the offering documents to the responsible SFC case officer.",
